 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K and in Note 17, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements. 3 Table of Contents Video Game Industry Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD") and International Development Group ("IDG"), we estimate that the combined market for new physical video game products and PC entertainment software was approximately $21.5 billion in 2014 in the countries in which we operate. Market Market Size (in billions) Data Source United States $ 13.1 NPD Canada 1.0 NPD Australia 1.1 NPD Europe 6.3 IDG Total $ 21.5 The electronic game industry referred to above consists of new physical video game products, such as hardware, video game and PC software and accessories, but excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $8 billion and $10 billion in 2014. New Video Game Products .  Video game products appeal to a wide array of consumers, from avid gamers spending many hours per week playing console gaming systems to casual game players enjoying social and mobile games on smart phones, tablets and other devices. The average game player is 31 years old, 71% of gamers are age 18 or older and 48% are female. We expect the following trends in sales of video game products: • Video Game Hardware. Gaming consoles are typically launched in cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in graphics, audio quality, gameplay, internet connectivity, social features and other entertainment capabilities beyond video gaming. The most recent cycle of consoles (referred to as “next generation”) includes the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One, which both launched in most of the countries in which we operate in November 2013, and the Nintendo Wii U, which launched in November 2012. The demand for the previous generation hardware has been in decline since 2011 and we expect that demand will continue to decline as consumers continue to move to the next generation consoles. In addition, portable handheld video game devices have evolved to the Nintendo 3DS and 2DS, which were introduced in 2011 and 2013, respectively, and the Sony PlayStation Vita, which was introduced in February 2012. The market for handheld devices has declined in recent years as the proliferation of smart-phones, tablets and other mobile devices offer video game players alternative ways to play games. • Video Game Software. Sales of video game software generally increase as gaming platforms mature and gain wider acceptance. Sales of video game software are dependent upon manufacturers and third-party publishers developing and releasing game titles for existing game platforms. In recent years the number of new games introduced each year has generally declined and as a result, the market for video game sales has also declined. With the introduction of the next generation consoles, we expect the number of new games introduced to increase and we expect demand for software for those devices to grow and demand for software for the previous generation of consoles to continue to decline. • Video Game Accessories. Sales of video game hardware also drive sales of video game accessories for use with the hardware and software. The most common video game accessories are controllers and gaming headsets. We expect demand for video game accessories for use on the next generation of consoles to increase as the installed base of these consoles increases. We expect the demand for accessories for use with the previous generation of consoles to decline as the sales of those consoles decline. Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. The installed base of video game hardware platforms continues to increase each year and continues to fuel the market for pre-owned video game hardware and software. Based on reports published by NPD, we believe that, as of December 2014, the installed base of next generation and the most recent previous generation video game hardware systems in the United States, based on original sales, totaled approximately 217 million units of handheld and console video game systems and grew by 16 million units in 2014. According to IDG, the installed base of active hardware systems of the same generations as of December 2014 in Europe was approximately 172 million units and grew by 14 million units in 2014. Hardware manufacturers and third-party software publishers have produced a wide variety of software titles for each of these hardware platforms. Based on internal estimates, we believe that 2.1 billion console video game and portable game units have been sold over the last 10 years. This fact, combined with the growth of the next-generation video game hardware and software, drives ongoing demand for pre-owned video game products. We believe that we are the leader in sales of pre-owned and value video game products. 4 Table of Contents Digital Gaming. The digital game market consists of both immersive and casual games delivered over the internet to consoles, computers, tablets, smart phones and other devices. We sell a variety of digitally downloadable content in our video game stores and on our websites.  The recent generations of video game consoles contain the technology to digitally download video game software content and a growing market has developed for the sale of digitally downloadable add-on content for physical games, which the electronic game industry calls “DLC” and, more recently, full game downloads. The next generation consoles increase the availability and ease of downloading game content and we expect the demand for downloadable video games to continue to grow as the installed base of the next generation of consoles grows. Casual Games. The casual game market consists primarily of digital games and has grown rapidly over the last few years. Casual games are generally defined as simple, easy-to-use, free or very low-priced games played through the internet in web browsers, on dedicated gaming websites, and increasingly, on mobile phones or other mobile devices. Casual games cost less to develop and distribute than a traditional console video game and are often supported by in-game advertising or user-purchased premium content. We earn revenues from browser-based games and mobile games through our Kongregate business, which is a leading platform for web and mobile gaming. Mobile and Consumer Electronics Industry Mobile and Consumer Electronics. The mobile and consumer electronics market, as we refer to it, consists primarily of wireless services, new and pre-owned mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, consumer electronics such as Apple products and services, non-gaming headsets and accessories. • Wireless Services and Products. Our Spring Mobile businesses are exclusive resellers of AT&T’s pre-paid and post-paid services, respectively, and a variety of phones, tablets and other wireless devices manufactured for use on AT&T’s network. The market for wireless devices and services is estimated by CTIA - The Wireless Association ® to be approximately $180 billion with growth projected over the next five years between 3-5% annually. We expect that the market for AT&T services and products and the wireless market in general will continue to grow as more and more wireless devices connect to the internet through wireless networks. • Mobile Devices. We define mobile devices as smart phones, tablets and related accessories. We sell new mobile devices in our Technology Brands stores. We buy, sell and trade pre-owned mobile devices and tablets in many of our Video Game Brands and Technology Brands stores. • Consumer Electronics. Our Simply Mac stores are authorized Apple resellers and also offer certified training, warranty and repair services to customers. Based on Apple public statements and filings, we expect the market for Apple products sold at retail in the U.S. to grow 5-10% annually over the next five years. Business and Growth Strategy Our vision is to continue to expand our business as a global family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple.  Our mission is to continue to be the world’s largest multichannel retailer of new and pre-owned and value video game products and to strategically expand our Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses to diversify our revenue streams. Additionally, following on the success of extending our core competencies into our mobile business, we continue to seek other opportunities to extend these competencies to other businesses and retail categories to continue to grow our company.  We have a broad-based executive management team with substantial experience in the retail sector in merchandising, marketing, supply chain management, store operations and real estate.  Our strategy is to leverage our management team and core competencies to identify other retail concepts that we can acquire and rapidly expand. We believe our core competencies include the following: • Real estate knowledge, including extensive relationships with landlords, portfolio management, negotiating skills and risk mitigation; • Human resource management, including hiring, training, systems and processes, particularly in multi-unit management of small, limited staffing, specialty retail stores with expert staff in assisted-selling; • Knowledge of buy-sell-trade programs, including pricing algorithms, inventory balancing, refurbishment capabilities and secondhand dealer laws; • Customer retention programs, including using our loyalty programs to drive consumer awareness of new retail concepts and promote new products; and • The ability to deploy capital in ways that diversify the underlying business, manage financial risk and increase shareholder value, including finding acquisitions that have a high return on invested capital and are accretive to earnings. 5 Table of Contents Our competencies in real estate and human resource management stem from our experience in rapid growth retail environments with a history of opening 300-400 stores annually. We have anchored our strategy and growth plans upon the following pillars, each of which are described more fully below: • Maximize brick and mortar stores; • Expand our pre-owned business; • Own the customer; • Expand our digital growth strategy; and • Disciplined capital allocation. Maximize Brick and Mortar Stores Maximizing our brick and mortar stores includes capturing and retaining the leading market share of the new console cycle, utilizing our stores to grow digital sales and applying our retail expertise to our Technology Brands businesses.  Our ability to execute this pillar of our strategic growth plan is dependent in part upon the following: • Consistently Achieving High New Release Market Share. We focus marketing efforts and store associates on driving the sale of new release video game products, both physical and digital. We employ a variety of rapid-response distribution methods in our efforts to be the first-to-market and consistently in-stock for new physical and digital video game products. This highly efficient distribution network is essential, as a significant portion of a new title’s sales will be generated in the first few days and weeks following its release. As the world’s largest retailer of video game products with a proven capability to distribute new releases to our customers quickly and capture market share immediately following new product launches, we believe we regularly receive larger allocations of popular new video game products. On a daily basis, we actively monitor sales trends, customer reservations and store manager feedback to ensure a high in-stock position for each store. To assist our customers in obtaining immediate access to new releases, we offer our customers the opportunity to pre-order products in our stores or through our websites prior to their release. • Enhancing our Image as a Destination Location. Our video game stores serve as destination locations for game players, mobile electronics consumers and gift givers due to our broad selection of products, compelling loyalty program offers, game-oriented environment, trade-in programs and unique pricing proposition. We offer all major video game platforms, provide a broad assortment of new and pre-owned video game products and offer a larger and more current selection of merchandise than other retailers. In our video game stores, we provide a high level of customer service by hiring game enthusiasts and providing them with ongoing sales training, including training in the latest technical and functional elements of our products and services, making them the most knowledgeable associates in the video game retail market. Our video game stores are equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers with the opportunity to view upcoming game trailers and play games before purchase. • Targeting a Broad Audience of Game Players. We have created store environments targeting a broad audience, including the video game enthusiast, the casual gamer and the seasonal gift giver. Our video game stores focus on the video game enthusiast who demands the latest merchandise featuring the “hottest” technology immediately on the day of release and the value-oriented customer who wants a wide selection of value-priced pre-owned video game products. Our buy-sell-trade program offers consumers the opportunity to trade-in pre-owned video game products in exchange for store credits applicable to future purchases, which, in turn, drives more sales. • Expanding our Technology Brands Businesses. We have entered into a strategic partnership with AT&T and are selling AT&T products and services in our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores and in some of our Simply Mac and U.S. GameStop stores. We acquired Spring Mobile in November 2013. Spring Mobile has grown from approximately 90 stores at the end of 2012 to 361 stores at January 31, 2015, through a program with two primary focuses. The first of these is opening what we refer to as “whitespace” stores, or new stores in retail locations identified by either AT&T or Spring Mobile management and agreed to by both parties. AT&T supports the opening of new whitespace stores by its resellers in an effort to increase the size of its retail distribution channel. The second focus is on acquiring smaller AT&T resellers. Both of these represent opportunities for strong growth in the near term for Spring Mobile. AT&T acquired Leap Wireless in 2014, including the Cricket Wireless brand, to compete in the pre-paid wireless market. The pre-paid sector of the wireless market is experiencing higher growth than the traditional post-paid market. Pre-paid customers are generally interested in paying for wireless service on a month-to-month basis without a longer-term contract. We began opening pre-paid wireless stores in a few markets in November 2013 and have expanded to over 60 Cricket Wireless stores operated by Spring Mobile as of the end of fiscal 2014 and expect to continue to expand our prepaid stores with AT&T. 6 Table of Contents Simply Mac has grown from 8 stores in the fall of 2012, when we acquired 49.9% of the company, to 60 stores as of the end of fiscal 2014. We completed the acquisition of the remaining ownership in Simply Mac in November 2013. Simply Mac’s primary focus for store expansions is in U.S. markets which generally do not have the size and demographics to make them attractive for an Apple-owned store. We intend to continue to open new Simply Mac stores in fiscal 2015 and the coming years. In connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands business, Spring Mobile and Simply Mac completed acquisitions of several additional AT&T resellers and authorized Apple retailers, respectively, in fiscal 2014. We continue to seek out opportunities to extend core competencies to other products and retail categories in order to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle. • Successfully Executing our Store Opening/Closing Strategy. We have an analysis-driven approach to store opening and closing decisions. We intend to continue to open a limited number of new Video Game Brands stores in targeted markets where we can take market share from uncontested competitors, as well as in markets in which we already operate where we have realized returns on invested capital that have exceeded our internal targets. We analyze each market relative to target population and other demographic indices, real estate availability, competitive factors and past operating history, if available. On average, our new stores opened in the past three fiscal years have had a return of original investment of less than two years. We are aggressive in the analysis of our existing store base to determine optimal levels of profitability and close stores where profitability goals are not being met or where we can attempt to transfer sales to other nearby existing stores and increase overall profits. We utilize our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program information to determine areas that are currently underserved and also utilize our database to ensure a high customer transfer rate from closing locations to existing locations. We opened 49 new Video Game Brands stores and closed 300 Video Game Brands stores in fiscal 2014, reducing our Video Game Brands store count by 3.9%, in excess of stated targets as we exited Spain and sold or closed 108 stores. We opened 109 new Video Game Brands stores and closed 254 Video Game Brands stores in the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2014 ("fiscal 2013"), reducing our Video Game Brands store count by 2.2%, in line with stated targets. We plan to open approximately 50 new Video Game Brands stores and close approximately 200-300 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2015. Expand our Pre-Owned Business We believe we are the largest retailer of pre-owned video game products in the world and carry the broadest selection of pre-owned and value video game products for both current and previous generation platforms, giving us a unique advantage in the video game retail industry. The opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned and value video game products offers our customers a unique value proposition generally unavailable at most mass merchants, toy stores and consumer electronics retailers. We obtain most of our pre-owned video game products from trade-ins made in our stores by our customers. We also obtain value-priced, or close-out, video game products at favorable prices from publishers, other retailers or distributors and can sell those products to value-conscious consumers in our stores. Pre-owned and value video game products generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our primary objectives in our pre-owned and value business are to continue to expand our product assortment to drive sales and gross profit growth and to gain market share in the value channel. Our strategy consists of increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of trading in and buying pre-owned video game products and value-priced video game products at our stores through increased marketing activities and the use of both broad and targeted marketing to our loyalty program members. The supply of value-priced video game products and trade-ins of video game products, and the demand for resale of these products, is affected by overall demand for video game products and the introduction of new software and hardware by our suppliers. We expect the continued adoption of next-generation consoles and software to drive close-out availability and trade-ins of older video game products, thereby expanding our supply of pre-owned and value video game products. Own the Customer Sustaining and growing our existing customer base is dependent upon our ability to increase GameStop brand awareness, to drive membership in our loyalty programs, to engage with customers through social media and our mobile apps, and to expand our market leadership position by offering a variety of new and pre-owned video game products and continuing to enhance our mobile and digital product and service offerings. Substantially all of GameStop’s U.S. and European video game stores are operated under the GameStop name, with the exception of the Micromania stores in France. Our Canadian and Australian video game stores operate under the EB Games name. We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. The Micromania stores introduced a loyalty program in the 1990s. Using this program as a model, we introduced our U.S. loyalty program called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards") in 2010. We introduced other loyalty programs in our video game stores in remaining countries between 2011 and 2014. Building our brands has enabled us to leverage the increased awareness to capture advertising and marketing efficiencies. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership 7 Table of Contents which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products. As of January 31, 2015, we had over 30 million members in our U.S. PowerUp Rewards program, approximately 7 million of which were paid members. In total, our loyalty programs around the world had approximately 41 million members. Our branding strategy is further supported by our websites which allow our customers to buy games online, reserve or pick up merchandise in our stores, order in-store for home delivery and to learn about the latest video game products and their availability in our stores. Together, our loyalty programs, websites, mobile applications, magazine and other properties are a part of our multi-channel retail strategy designed to enhance our relationships with our customers, make it easier for our customers to transact with us and increase brand loyalty. In fiscal 2015, we plan to continue to aggressively promote our loyalty programs and increase brand awareness over a broader demographic area in order to promote our unique buying experience in-store for new and pre-owned hardware and software, trade-ins of pre-owned video game and mobile consumer electronics products and to leverage our websites. Expand our Digital Growth Strategy We expect that future growth in the electronic game industry will be driven by the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of gaming. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as DLC, for existing console video games. To respond to this demand, we currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including Xbox Live, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and online timecards and DLC. We believe we are the only significant brick-and-mortar retail seller of DLC and that we are frequently the leading seller of DLC for most major game titles. Additionally, we operate Kongregate, which is a leading platform for web and mobile gaming that has attracted over 3.3 billion web gameplays and over 600 million mobile gameplays since its launch. Kongregate is also a publisher of mobile games and has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores, which have received over 36 million mobile installs. While all Kongregate games are free to play, the website features a proprietary virtual currency called "Kreds" that can be used to unlock upgrades and features, and mobile games may also include items available for purchase. We intend to continue investing in the expansion of Kongregate's mobile game publishing platform through the development of new games designed to appeal to core gamers across the Kongregate and GameStop networks. We will continue to make strategic investments in multichannel, digital delivery systems, mobile applications and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to access digital content and eliminate friction in the digital sales and delivery process. We also plan to continue to grow our digital sales base through our in-store offerings as well as through our online and mobile gaming platforms. Disciplined Capital Allocation Our objective is to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends unless more strategic opportunities arise that we believe would create more meaningful shareholder returns.  In an effort to continue our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value we have accomplished the following in fiscal 2014 and thus far in fiscal 2015: • Quarterly Cash Dividend. In fiscal 2014, we paid dividends of $1.32 per share of Class A Common Stock, totaling approximately $148.8 million for the year.  Additionally, on March 3, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend from $1.32 to $1.44 per share of Class A Common Stock, which represents an increase of 9%. On March 3, 2015, we declared our first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2015 of $0.36 per share of Class A Common Stock, payable on March 24, 2015 to stockholders of record on March 17, 2015. • Share Repurchase Program. In fiscal 2014, we repurchased 8.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price per share of $39.50 for a total of $333.4 million. On November 11, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized $500.0 million of funds to be used to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock, replacing the $176.4 million remaining under our previous authorization. • Strategic Capital Opportunities. In order to create more meaningful shareholder returns, as we evaluate investments in strategic opportunities, we target internal rates of return (“IRR”) in excess of 20% for whitespace store expansion and acquisitions. For fiscal 2014, the collective target IRR of the stores we opened and the AT&T and Apple resellers we acquired was 24%. 8 Table of Contents Merchandise Substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sale of tangible products; however, we also sell downloadable software and subscription, time and points cards, which do not involve physical product. Our product offerings consist of new and pre-owned video game products, and related products, such as video game accessories, headsets, interactive toys and licensed merchandise and strategy guides, as well as new and pre-owned mobile devices such as tablets, phones and music players. Our in-store inventory generally consists of a constantly changing selection of over 5,000 SKUs. We have buying groups in each of our segments that negotiate terms, discounts and cooperative advertising allowances for the stores in their respective geographic areas. We use customer requests and feedback, pre-orders, industry magazines and product reviews to determine which new releases are expected to be hits. Pre-orders are tracked at individual stores to distribute titles and capture demand effectively. This merchandise management is essential because a significant portion of a game’s sales are usually generated in the first days and weeks following its release. We categorize our sale of products and services as follows: New Video Game Hardware. We offer the video game platforms of all major manufacturers, including the Sony PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Kinect and the Nintendo Wii U, Wii and DS line. We also offer extended service agreements on video game hardware and software. In support of our strategy to be the destination location for electronic game players, we aggressively promote the sale of video game platforms. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. We are in a new console cycle beginning with the Nintendo Wii U launch in November 2012 and the launches of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. We believe that selling video game hardware increases store traffic and promotes customer loyalty, leading to increased sales of video game software and accessories, which have higher gross margins than video game hardware. New Video Game Software. We purchase new video game software from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision. We are one of the largest customers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We generally carry over 600 SKUs of new video game software at any given time across a variety of genres, including Sports, Action, Strategy, Adventure/Role Playing and Simulation. Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We believe we are the largest retailer of pre-owned video games in the world. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We have the largest selection (approximately 3,000 SKUs) of pre-owned and value video game titles which have an average price of $23 as compared to an average price of $45 for new video game titles and which generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our trade-in program provides our customers with a unique value proposition which is generally unavailable at mass merchants, toy stores and consumer electronics retailers. From time to time we have purchased value-priced, or closeout, video game products from publishers, distributors or other retailers and we can resell these products for gross margins that are more similar to pre-owned video game products than margins on new software. We refer to these as "value" products.  These programs provide us with an inventory of pre-owned and value video game products which we resell to our more value-oriented customers. In addition, our highly-customized inventory management system allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned and value video game products across our store base and to reallocate our inventory as necessary. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as DLC, for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency and we have developed technology to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency sales and the sale of DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. We believe that we are frequently the leading seller of DLC for most major game titles. Mobile and Consumer Electronics. Our mobile and consumer electronics business consists of the sale of new smart phones, tablets, headphones and accessories and buying, selling and trading of select pre-owned smart phones, tablets and MP3 players in a majority of stores in our U.S. and international markets. Beginning in November 2013, this product category also includes the revenues generated in our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores and Simply Mac stores from the sales of wireless products and services and Apple and other consumer electronics. Other Products. We purchase PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision. We offer PC entertainment software across a variety of genres, including Sports, Action, Strategy, Adventure/Role Playing and Simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and gaming-related toys, such as Amiibos from 9 Table of Contents Nintendo, Skylanders from Activision and licensed merchandise and collectibles primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries. Store Operations As of January 31, 2015 , we operated 6,690 stores, primarily under the names GameStop, EB Games and Micromania. We design our stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout. Our stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us. Our Video Game Brands stores average approximately 1,400 square feet and carry a balanced mix of new and pre-owned and value video game products and mobile products. Our Technology Brands stores vary in size, with an average size of approximately 1,800 square feet. Our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores carry wireless products and accessories, and our Simply Mac stores carry Apple and other consumer electronics. Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Site Selection and Locations Site Selection. Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores are selected after approval from AT&T. Simply Mac stores are selected with input from Apple. Most of our stores are located in highly visible locations within malls and strip centers. In each of our geographic segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations. 10 Table of Contents Domestic Locations.

Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our stores throughout most of the world. Game Informer magazine is the fourth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2014 issue, the magazine had approximately 7 million paid subscribers, including over 2.7 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the world. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program as a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. We also operate the website www.gameinformer.com , which is the premier destination for moment-by-moment news, features and reviews related to video gaming. In 2014, the website averaged over 2.9 million monthly unique visitors. Game Informer revenues are also generated through the sale of advertising space in Game Informer magazine and on www.gameinformer.com . Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. 12 Table of Contents Multichannel We operate several electronic commerce websites in various countries, including www.gamestop.com , www.ebgames.com.au , www.ebgames.co.nz , www.gamestop.ca , www.gamestop.it , www.gamestop.ie , www.gamestop.de , www.gamestop.co.uk and www.micromania.fr , that allow our customers to buy video game products and other merchandise online and, in some cases, allow customers to reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. The sites also offer customers information and content about available games, release dates for upcoming games, and access to store information, such as location and product availability. Additionally, we offer over 1,500 titles of digitally downloadable PC video games at www.gamestop.com . E-commerce results are included in the geographic segment where the sales originate. Additionally, with the launch of our new GameStop mobile app in 2014, smart phone users can browse our extensive product selection and experience an enhanced PowerUp Rewards dashboard.  We estimate that the GameStop mobile app has been installed over 5 million times. Additionally, in 2014, we launched the GameStop Technology Institute to partner with leading technology corporations and academic institutions to enhance consumer interaction technologies and develop business solutions that help to drive traffic to all of our retail channels. Kongregate We operate Kongregate, which is a leading web and mobile gaming platform. Over 25,000 developers have uploaded more than 90,000 games to www.kongregate.com that have seen over 3.3 billion gameplays since its launch. The majority of Kongregate’s revenues come from its mobile apps and in-game transactions utilizing a proprietary virtual currency called Kreds. Kongregate’s mobile publishing division has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores. Advertising Our stores are primarily located in high traffic, high visibility areas of regional shopping malls, strip centers and pedestrian shopping areas. Given the high foot traffic drawn past the stores themselves, we use in-store marketing efforts such as window displays and “coming soon” signs to attract customers, as well as to promote our products. Inside our stores, we feature selected products through the use of vendor displays, “coming soon” or preview videos, signs, catalogs, point-of-purchase materials and end-cap displays. These advertising efforts are designed to increase the initial sales of new titles upon their release. On a global basis, we receive cooperative advertising and market development funds from most of our manufacturers, distributors, software publishers and accessory suppliers to promote their respective products. Generally, vendors agree to purchase advertising space in one of our advertising vehicles. Once we run the advertising, the vendor pays us an agreed amount. We have loyalty programs in all of the markets in which we operate. Our various loyalty programs total over 41 million members worldwide. These programs are designed to incent our customers to shop more often at our stores and to allow us to market directly to our customers based on their individual tastes and preferences. Our loyalty programs provide members with the opportunity to earn unique video game related rewards not available through any other retailer. Vendors also participate in these programs to increase the sales of their individual products. Our PowerUp Rewards program in the United States gives our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership that offers points earned on purchases in our stores, on our U.S. website and on our Kongregate website, which can be redeemed for discounts or merchandise. The program’s paid tier also includes a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on selected merchandise and additional credit on trade-ins in our stores. In the last several years, as part of our brand-building efforts and targeted growth strategies, we expanded our advertising and promotional activities in certain targeted markets at certain key times of the year. In addition, we expanded our use of television and radio advertising in certain markets to promote brand awareness and store openings. We expect our investment in advertising through our loyalty programs to increase as we continue to expand our membership base and build our brand. Information Management and Distribution Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Distribution. We operate distribution facilities in various locations throughout the world, with each location strategically located to support the operations in a particular country or region. In order to enhance our first-to-market distribution network, we also utilize the services of several off-site, third-party operated distribution centers that pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles at our facilities and third-party facilities and deliver those shipments to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores. Inventory is shipped to each 13 Table of Contents store at least twice a week, or daily, if necessary, in order to keep stores in supply of products. Our distribution facilities also typically support refurbishment of pre-owned products to be redistributed to our stores. We distribute video game products to our U.S. stores through a 353,000 square foot distribution center in Grapevine, Texas and a 260,000 square foot distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky. We currently use the center in Louisville, Kentucky to support our first-to-market distribution efforts, while our Grapevine, Texas facility supports efforts to replenish stores. The state-of-the-art facilities in both U.S. locations are designed to effectively control and minimize inventory levels. Technologically-advanced conveyor systems and flow-through racks control costs and improve speed of fulfillment in both facilities. The technology used in the distribution centers allows for high-volume receiving, distributions to stores and returns to vendors. We distribute merchandise to our Canadian segment from two distribution centers in Brampton, Ontario. We have a distribution center near Brisbane, Australia which supports our Australian operations and a small distribution facility in New Zealand which supports the stores in New Zealand. European segment operations are supported by five regionally-located distribution centers in Milan, Italy; Memmingen, Germany; Arlov, Sweden; Dublin, Ireland; and Paris, France. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art facilities in our distribution centers as the distribution volume, number of stores supported and returns on such investments permit. Digital Distribution. We have developed proprietary technology to work in conjunction with developers, as well as Microsoft and Sony, to enable us to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our e-commerce sites. The DLC typically available today consists of add-on content developed by publishers for existing games. Management Information Systems. Our proprietary inventory management systems and point-of-sale technology show daily sales and in-store stock by title by store. Our systems use this data to automatically generate replenishment shipments to each store from our distribution centers, enabling each store to carry a merchandise assortment uniquely tailored to its own sales mix and rate of sale. Our call lists and reservation system also provide our buying staff with information to determine order size and inventory management for store-by-store inventory allocation. We constantly review and edit our merchandise categories with the objective of ensuring that inventory is up-to-date and meets customer needs. To support most of our operations, we use a large-scale, Intel-based computing environment with a state-of-the-art storage area network and a wired and wireless corporate network installed at our U.S. and regional international headquarters, and a secure, virtual private network to access and provide services to computing assets located in our stores, distribution centers and satellite offices and to our mobile workforce. This strategy has proven to minimize initial outlay of capital while allowing for flexibility and growth as operations expand. Computing assets and our mobile workforce around the globe access this environment via a secure, virtual private network. Regional communication links exist to each of our distribution centers and offices in international locations with connectivity to our U.S. data center as required by our international, distributed applications. Our in-store point-of-sale system enables us to efficiently manage in-store transactions. This proprietary point-of-sale system has been enhanced to facilitate trade-in transactions, including automatic look-up of trade-in prices and printing of machine-readable bar codes to facilitate in-store restocking of pre-owned video games. In addition, our central database of all pre-owned and value video game products allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and reallocate our pre-owned and value video game products as necessary. Field Management and Staff Each of our Video Game Brands stores employs, on average, one manager, one assistant manager and between two and ten sales associates, many of whom are part-time employees. Each store manager is responsible for managing their personnel and the economic performance of their store. We have cultivated a work environment that attracts employees who are actively interested in electronic games. We seek to hire and retain employees who know and enjoy working with our products so that they are better able to assist customers. To encourage them to sell the full range of our products and to maximize our profitability, we provide our employees with targeted incentive programs to drive overall sales and sales of higher margin products. In certain locations, we also provide certain employees with the opportunity to take home and try new video games, which enables them to better discuss those games with our customers. In addition, employees are casually dressed to encourage customer access and increase the “game-oriented” focus of the stores. Our stores communicate with our corporate offices daily via e-mail. This e-mail allows for better tracking of trends in upcoming titles, competitor strategies and in-stock inventory positions. In addition, this electronic communication allows title selection in each store to be continuously updated and tailored to reflect the tastes and buying patterns of the store’s local market. These communications also give field management access to relevant inventory levels and loss prevention information and the opportunity to communicate directly with our executives. We have invested in significant management training programs for our store managers and our district managers to enhance their business management skills. We also sponsor annual store managers’ conferences at which we operate intense educational training programs to provide our employees with information about the video game products that will be released by publishers in the holiday season. All video game software publishers are invited to attend the conferences. Our U.S. Video Game Brands store operations are managed by four market vice presidents of stores and 30 regional store operations directors. The regions are further divided into districts, each with a district manager covering an average of 14 stores. 14 Table of Contents In total, there are approximately 300 districts. Our international operations are managed by a senior executive. The stores in Europe are managed by a senior vice president and three vice presidents, who each manage a region or country in the European segment. We also employ a vice president in Europe who assists the regions in leveraging the purchasing and merchandising of our products. Our stores in Australia and Canada are each managed by a vice president. We operate the Technology Brands stores with a field management and store management structure similar to that of our Video Game Brands stores. Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores are managed by a senior vice president of stores who manages three vice presidents. These vice presidents manage nine regional directors, each of whom manages between four and eight district managers. These district managers manage between five and 13 stores. Our Spring Mobile managed Cricket Wireless branded stores are managed by a vice president who oversees three regional managers, each of whom manages a geographic market containing between 14 and 30 stores. Simply Mac stores operate with a vice president of stores overseeing eight district managers, each of whom supervises between six and 12 store managers. Customer Service Our store personnel provide value-added services to each customer, such as maintaining lists of regular customers and reserving new releases for customers with a down payment to ensure product availability. In addition, our store personnel readily provide product reviews and ratings to ensure customers are making informed purchasing decisions and inform customers of available resources, including Game Informer and our e-commerce sites, to increase a customer’s enjoyment of the product upon purchase. Vendors We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from over 80 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors accounted for approximately 85% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2014 .   Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Activision accounted for 24%, 17%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our new product purchases during fiscal 2014 . We have established price protections and return privileges with our primary vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we have few purchase contracts with trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Competition The electronic game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart, Best Buy and its subsidiary Future Shop. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores compete with AT&T corporate-owned stores, other AT&T authorized resellers, mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, among others, as well as other pre-paid and post-paid wireless carriers and their distribution channels, including Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our Simply Mac stores compete with Apple, including online and corporate owned Apple stores, mass-market retailers as noted above, and other authorized Apple resellers. Our Spring Mobile managed Cricket Wireless branded stores compete with the pre-paid and post-paid wireless service offerings of AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other prepaid brands including Boost, GoPhone and MetroPCS. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2014, we generated approximately 37% of our sales during the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2013, we generated approximately 41% of our sales during the fourth quarter. 15 Table of Contents Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “Spring Mobile,” “Simply Mac,” “Kongregate,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 18,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 29,000 and 55,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.

Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to goodwill impairments of $627.0 million resulting from our interim goodwill impairment tests performed during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment charges. (2) Results for fiscal 2014 include impairment charges of $2.2 million, comprised of $1.9 million of property and equipment impairments and $0.3 million of intangible asset impairments. Results for fiscal 2013 include impairments of $18.5 million, of which $7.4 million and $2.1 million were related to certain technology assets and other intangible assets, respectively, as a result of our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs and the remaining $9.0 million was related to property and equipment impairments resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to asset impairments of $53.7 million, of which $44.9 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name and $8.8 million relates to other impairment charges from the evaluations of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2011 include charges related to asset impairments and restructuring charges of $81.2 million, of which $37.8 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name, $22.7 million relates to the impairment of investments in non-core businesses and $20.7 million relates to other impairments, termination benefits and facility closure costs. Results for fiscal 2010 include impairment charges resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets. (3) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2015 compares the 52 weeks for the period ended January 31, 2015 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as a multi-channel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (4) On September 24, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.50% senior notes due October 1, 2019 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on April 1, 2015. The Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. The Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. See Note 10, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Senior Notes. 31 Table of Contents

 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K and in Note 17, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements. Our Strategy During the past few years, we have transformed from the world’s largest specialty retailer of physical video game products into a family of retail brands selling many of the world’s most popular technologies and pop-culture products. Our vision is to continue to expand our business as a global family of specialty retail brands.  Our mission is to continue to be the world’s largest omnichannel retailer of new and pre-owned and value video game products, to continue to grow sales of digital products, to expand the sales of collectible products through our video game stores and www.thinkgeek.com , to increase the number of our pop culture-themed stores and to strategically grow our Technology Brands segment to further diversify our revenue streams.  Our goal is to have 50% or more of our operating earnings for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”) come from sources other than physical gaming. Additionally, following on the success of extending our core competencies into our mobile business, we continue to seek other opportunities to extend these competencies to other businesses and retail categories to continue to grow our company.  We have a broad-based executive management team with substantial experience in the retail sector in merchandising, marketing, supply chain management, store operations and real estate.  Our strategy is to leverage our management team and core competencies to identify other retail concepts that we can acquire and rapidly expand. We believe our core competencies include the following: • Real estate knowledge, including extensive relationships with landlords, portfolio management, negotiating skills and risk mitigation; • Human resource management, including hiring, training, systems and processes, particularly in multi-unit management of small, limited staffing, specialty retail stores with expert staff in assisted-selling; • Knowledge of buy-sell-trade programs, including pricing algorithms, inventory balancing, refurbishment capabilities and secondhand dealer laws; • Customer retention programs, including using our loyalty programs to drive consumer awareness of new retail concepts and promote new products; and • The ability to deploy capital in ways that diversify the underlying business, manage financial risk and increase shareholder value, including finding acquisitions that have a high return on invested capital and are accretive to earnings. Our competencies in real estate and human resource management stem from our experience in rapid growth retail environments with a history of opening 300-400 stores annually, including growing our Technology Brands segment by over 550 stores during the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2015”). We have anchored our strategy and growth plans upon the following pillars: • Maximize brick and mortar stores. Our strategy regarding our retail stores includes growing our leading market share in video games, utilizing our stores to grow digital sales and applying our retail expertise to our Technology Brands businesses. Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We expect to open approximately 140 new stores in fiscal 2016, including 90 Video Game Brands stores (including 84 collectibles stores) and 50 Technology Brands stores. Our strategy also includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring sales to other nearby GameStop locations. We plan to close approximately 200 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2016. In our video game stores, we provide a high level of customer service by hiring game enthusiasts and providing them with ongoing sales training, including training in the latest technical and functional elements of our products and services, making them the most knowledgeable associates in the video game retail market. We focus marketing efforts and store 3 Table of Contents associates on driving the sale of new release video game products, both physical and digital. As the world’s largest retailer of video game products with a proven capability to capture market share immediately following new product launches, we believe we regularly receive larger allocations of popular new video game products than our competitors. To assist our customers in obtaining immediate access to new releases, we offer our customers the opportunity to pre-order products in our stores or through our websites prior to their release. Our Technology Brands businesses center around two strategic relationships: a long-term partnership with AT&T under which we sell AT&T products and services in our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and certain AT&T products and services in our Simply Mac stores, and an agreement with Apple under which we sell Apple products and services in our Simply Mac stores. We acquired Spring Mobile in November 2013. Spring Mobile has grown from approximately 90 AT&T branded stores at the end of 2012 to 890 stores as of January 30, 2016 , through a program with two primary focuses. The first of these  is to acquire AT&T resellers. The second is opening what we refer to as “whitespace” stores, or new stores in retail locations identified by either AT&T or Spring Mobile management and agreed to by both parties. AT&T supports the opening of new whitespace stores by its resellers in an effort to increase the size of its retail distribution channel. Both of these represent opportunities for strong growth in the near term for Spring Mobile. We began opening pre-paid wireless stores in a few markets in November 2013 and have expanded to 70 Cricket stores operated by Spring Mobile as of the end of fiscal 2015 and expect to continue to expand our prepaid stores with AT&T. Simply Mac has grown from 8 stores in the fall of 2012, when we acquired 49.9% of the company, to 76 stores as of the end of fiscal 2015 . We completed the acquisition of the remaining ownership in Simply Mac in November 2013. We intend to continue to open new Simply Mac stores in the coming years. Simply Mac’s primary focus for store expansion is in U.S. markets which generally do not have the size and demographics to make them attractive for an Apple-owned store. In connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands business, Spring Mobile and Simply Mac completed acquisitions of several additional AT&T resellers and an authorized Apple retailer, respectively, in fiscal 2015 . We continue to seek opportunities to extend core competencies to other products and retail categories in order to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle. In July 2015, we purchased ThinkGeek, an online and wholesale retailer and developer that sells pop culture themed collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers through the www.thinkgeek.com website and certain exclusive products to wholesale channel customers. The addition of ThinkGeek provides an expansion of our global omnichannel platform and enables us to broaden our product offering in the collectibles category, including standalone stores and deepen relationships with our existing customer base. • Expand our pre-owned business. We believe we are the largest retailer of pre-owned video game products in the world and carry the broadest selection of pre-owned and value video game products for both current and previous generation platforms, giving us a unique advantage in the video game retail industry. The opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned video game products offers our customers a unique value proposition generally unavailable at most mass merchants, toy stores and consumer electronics retailers. We obtain most of our pre-owned video game products from trade-ins made in our stores by our customers. Pre-owned and value video game products generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our strategy consists of continuing to expand our product assortment to drive sales and gross profit growth, increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of trading in and buying pre-owned video game products through increased marketing activities and the use of both broad and targeted marketing to our loyalty program members. The supply of trade-ins of video game products, and the demand for resale of these products, is affected by overall demand for video game products and the introduction of new software and hardware by our suppliers. We expect the continued adoption of next-generation consoles and software to drive trade-ins of video game products, thereby expanding our supply of pre-owned video game products. Our Simply Mac stores also offer customers the opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned Apple products. • Own the customer . Sustaining and growing our existing customer base is dependent upon our ability to increase GameStop brand awareness, to drive membership in our loyalty programs, to engage with customers online, through social media and our mobile apps, and to expand our market leadership position by offering a variety of new and pre-owned video game products and continuing to enhance our mobile and digital product and service offerings. We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had over 33 million members as of January 30, 2016 . Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had over 13 million members as of January 30, 2016 . Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned 4 Table of Contents products. Approximately 6 million of the 33 million U.S. loyalty members were paying members. Our websites allow our customers to buy games online, reserve or pick up merchandise in our stores, order in-store for home delivery and to learn about the latest video game products and their availability in our stores. Together, our loyalty programs, websites, mobile applications, magazine and other properties are a part of our omnichannel retail strategy designed to enhance our relationships with our customers, making it easier for our customers to transact with us and increase loyalty. Our store personnel provide value-added services to each customer, such as maintaining lists of regular customers and reserving new releases for customers with a down payment to ensure product availability. In addition, our store personnel readily provide product reviews and ratings to ensure customers are making informed purchasing decisions and inform customers of available resources, including Game Informer and our e-commerce sites, to increase a customer’s enjoyment of the product upon purchase. • Expand our digital growth strategy . Growth in the video game industry in recent years has been fueled by the proliferation of online game play, the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of digital gaming. The recent generations of video game consoles contain the technology to digitally download video game software content and a growing market has developed for the sale of digitally downloadable add-on content for physical games, which the video game industry calls “DLC” and, more recently, full game downloads. The digital game market also consists of both immersive and casual games delivered over the internet to computers, tablets, smart phones and other devices. We sell a variety of digitally downloadable content in our video game stores and on our websites, including DLC, full game downloads, network points cards, prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We believe we are the only significant brick-and-mortar retail seller of DLC and that we are frequently the leading seller of DLC for most major game titles. Additionally, we operate Kongregate, which is a leading platform for web and mobile gaming that has attracted over 4.9 billion web gameplays and over 2.0 billion mobile gameplays since its launch. Kongregate is also a publisher of mobile games and has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores, which have received over 65 million mobile installs. We intend to continue investing in the expansion of Kongregate's mobile game publishing platform through the development of new games designed to appeal to core gamers across the Kongregate and GameStop networks. • Maintain a disciplined capital allocation . Our objective in recent years has been to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends unless more strategic opportunities arise that we believe would create more meaningful shareholder returns. In fiscal 2015 , we paid dividends of $1.44 per share of Class A Common Stock, totaling approximately $ 154.1 million for the year.  Additionally, on February 23, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend to $1.48 per share of Class A Common Stock, with the first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2016 of $0.37 per share of Class A Common Stock, payable on March 22, 2016 to stockholders of record on March 8, 2016. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price per share of $38.68 for a total of $202.0 million . In order to create more meaningful shareholder returns, as we evaluate investments in strategic opportunities, we target internal rates of return (“IRR”) in excess of 20% for whitespace store expansion and acquisitions. The total consideration of the completed acquisitions of additional AT&T resellers and an authorized Apple retailer in fiscal 2015 was $141.5 million net of cash acquired. The total consideration paid for ThinkGeek in July 2015, was $126.0 million, net of $13.9 million of cash acquired. Market Size Video Game Products. Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD") and International Development Group ("IDG"), we estimate that the combined market for new physical video game products and PC entertainment software was approximately $20.3 billion in 2015 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $8 billion and $10 billion in 2015 . Mobile and Consumer Electronics. The mobile and consumer electronics market, as we refer to it, consists primarily of wireless services, new and pre-owned mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, consumer electronics such as Apple products and services, non-gaming headsets and accessories. The market for wireless devices and services is estimated by CTIA - The Wireless Association ® to be approximately $196 billion. We expect that the market for AT&T services and products and the wireless market in general will continue to grow as more and more wireless devices connect to the internet through wireless networks and as AT&T continues to broaden its offerings of content and services, such as DirecTV. 5 Table of Contents Merchandise We categorize our sale of products and services as follows: New Video Game Hardware. We offer the video game platforms of all major manufacturers, including the Sony PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Kinect and the Nintendo Wii U, Wii and DS line. We also offer extended service agreements on video game hardware and software. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. We are in a console cycle which began with the Nintendo Wii U launch in November 2012 and the launches of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. We believe that selling video game hardware increases store traffic and promotes customer loyalty, leading to increased sales of video game software and accessories, which have higher gross margins than video game hardware. New Video Game Software. We purchase new video game software from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision. We are one of the largest customers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We generally carry approximately 600 SKUs of new video game software at any given time across a variety of genres, including Sports, Action, Strategy, Adventure/Role Playing and Simulation. Pre-owned Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection (approximately 3,000 SKUs) of pre-owned video game titles which have an average price of $23 as compared to an average price of $44 for new video game titles and which generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our highly-customized inventory management system allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and to reallocate our inventory as necessary. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as DLC, for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency and we have developed technology to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency sales and the sale of DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. Mobile and Consumer Electronics. Our mobile and consumer electronics business consists primarily of the revenues generated in our Technology Brands segment through Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and Simply Mac stores from the sales of wireless products and services and Apple and other consumer electronics. This product category also includes the sale of headphones and accessories and buying, selling and trading of select pre-owned smart phones in a majority of stores in our U.S. and international markets. Other Products. Our sales of licensed merchandise and collectibles primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com have grown dramatically in fiscal 2015 to over $300 million. We also offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision across a variety of genres, including Sports, Action, Strategy, Adventure/Role Playing and Simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and gaming-related toys, such as Amiibos from Nintendo, Skylanders from Activision and Infinity from Disney. The products in our Video Games Brands segments are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise being the timing of release of new products in the various geographies, language translations and the timing of roll-outs of newly developed technology enabling the sale of new digital products. Our in-store video game product inventory generally consists of a constantly changing selection of over 5,000 SKUs. We have buying groups in each of our segments that negotiate terms, discounts and cooperative advertising allowances for the stores in their respective geographic areas. We use customer requests and feedback, pre-orders, industry magazines and product reviews to determine which new releases are expected to be hits. Pre-orders are tracked at individual stores to distribute titles and capture demand effectively. This merchandise management is essential because a significant portion of a game’s sales are usually generated in the first days and weeks following its release. Store Operations We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,400 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, 6 Table of Contents which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us. Our Technology Brands stores vary in size, with an average size of approximately 1,800 square feet. Our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores carry wireless products and accessories, and our Simply Mac stores carry Apple and other consumer electronics. Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Site Selection and Locations Site Selection. Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores are selected after approval from AT&T. Simply Mac stores are selected with input from Apple.

Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our stores throughout most of the world. Game Informer magazine is the fourth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2015 issue, the magazine had approximately 6.8 million paid subscribers, including over 2.6 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the world. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Omnichannel We operate several electronic commerce websites in various countries, including www.gamestop.com , www.ebgames.com.au , www.ebgames.co.nz , www.gamestop.ca , www.gamestop.it , www.gamestop.ie , www.gamestop.de , www.gamestop.co.uk, www.micromania.fr and www.thinkgeek.com, that allow our customers to buy video game products and other merchandise online and allow customers to reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. The sites also offer customers information and content about available games, release dates for upcoming games, and access to store information, such as location and product availability. E-commerce results are included in the geographic segment where the sales originate. Additionally, with our GameStop mobile app, smart phone users can browse our extensive product selection and experience an enhanced PowerUp Rewards dashboard.  We estimate that the GameStop mobile app has been installed over 6 million times. 8 Table of Contents Kongregate We operate Kongregate, which is a leading web and mobile gaming platform. Over 31,000 developers have uploaded more than 106,000 games to www.kongregate.com. The majority of Kongregate’s revenues come from its mobile apps and in-game transactions utilizing a proprietary virtual currency called Kreds. Kongregate’s mobile publishing division has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores. Advertising Given the high foot traffic drawn past our stores, we use in-store marketing efforts such as window displays and “coming soon” signs to attract customers, as well as to promote our products. Inside our stores, we feature selected products through the use of vendor displays, “coming soon” or preview videos, signs, catalogs, point-of-purchase materials and end-cap displays. These advertising efforts are designed to increase the initial sales of new titles upon their release. On a global basis, we receive cooperative advertising and market development funds from most of our manufacturers, distributors, software publishers and accessory suppliers to promote their respective products. Generally, vendors agree to purchase advertising space in one of our advertising vehicles. Once we run the advertising, the vendor pays us an agreed amount. Our loyalty programs are designed to incent our customers to shop more often at our stores and to allow us to market directly to our customers based on their individual tastes and preferences. Our loyalty programs provide members with the opportunity to earn unique video game related rewards not available through any other retailer. Vendors also participate in these programs to increase the sales of their individual products. In the last several years, as part of our brand-building efforts and targeted growth strategies, we expanded our advertising and promotional activities in certain targeted markets at key times of the year. In addition, we expanded our use of television and radio advertising in certain markets to promote brand awareness, our pre-owned business and store openings. We expect our investment in advertising to increase. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Distribution. We operate distribution facilities in various locations throughout the world, with each location strategically located to support the operations in a particular country or region. In order to enhance our first-to-market distribution network, we also utilize the services of several off-site, third-party operated distribution centers that pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. Inventory is shipped to each store at least twice a week, or daily, if necessary, in order to keep stores in supply of products. Our distribution facilities also typically support refurbishment of pre-owned products to be redistributed to our stores. We distribute video game products to our U.S. stores through a 353,000 square foot distribution center in Grapevine, Texas and a 260,000 square foot distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky. The technology used in the distribution centers allows for high-volume receiving and distributions to stores. We distribute merchandise to our Canadian segment from two distribution centers in Brampton, Ontario. We have a distribution center near Brisbane, Australia which supports our Australian operations and a small distribution facility in New Zealand which supports the stores in New Zealand. European segment operations are supported by five regionally-located distribution centers in Milan, Italy; Memmingen, Germany; Arlov, Sweden; Dublin, Ireland; and Paris, France. Digital Distribution. We have developed proprietary technology to work in conjunction with developers, as well as Microsoft and Sony, to enable us to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our e-commerce sites. Management Information Systems. Our proprietary inventory management systems and point-of-sale technology show daily sales and in-store stock by title by store. Our systems use this data to automatically generate replenishment shipments to each store from our distribution centers, enabling each store to carry a merchandise assortment uniquely tailored to its own sales mix and rate of sale. Our call lists and reservation system also provide our buying staff with information to determine order size and inventory management for store-by-store inventory allocation. To support most of our operations, we use a large-scale, Intel-based computing environment with a state-of-the-art storage area network and a wired and wireless corporate network installed at our U.S. and regional international headquarters, and a secure, virtual private network to access and provide services to computing assets located in our stores, distribution centers and satellite offices and to our mobile workforce. This strategy has proven to minimize initial outlay of capital while allowing for flexibility and growth as operations expand. Regional communication links exist to each of our distribution centers and offices in international locations with connectivity to our U.S. data center as required by our international, distributed applications. 9 Table of Contents Our proprietary point-of-sale system has been enhanced to facilitate trade-in transactions, including automatic look-up of trade-in prices and printing of machine-readable bar codes to facilitate in-store restocking of pre-owned video games. In addition, our central database of all pre-owned and value video game products allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and reallocate our pre-owned and value video game products as necessary. Field Management and Staff Each of our Video Game Brands stores employs, on average, one store leader, one assistant store leader and between two and ten sales associates, many of whom are part-time employees. Each store leader is responsible for managing their personnel and the economic performance of their store. We have cultivated a work environment that attracts employees who are actively interested in video games so that they are better able to assist customers. To encourage them to sell the full range of our products and to maximize our profitability, we provide our employees with targeted incentive programs to drive overall sales and sales of higher margin products. Our stores communicate with our corporate offices daily via e-mail. This e-mail allows for better tracking of trends in upcoming titles, competitor strategies and in-stock inventory positions and the opportunity to communicate directly with our executives. We have invested in significant management training programs for our store leaders and our district leaders to enhance their business management skills. We also sponsor our annual store leaders’ conferences at which we conduct intense educational training programs to provide our video game store employees with information about the upcoming video game products that will be released by publishers during the holiday season. All video game software publishers and vendors are invited to attend the conferences. Our Video Game Brands store operations are managed by market vice presidents or managing directors (in the case of international markets) who directly supervise regional leaders. The regions are further divided into districts, each with a district leader covering an average of 15 stores. Our Technology Brands segment is managed by a senior vice president who manages a vice president for each of our three store concepts. We operate the AT&T branded, Cricket branded and Simply Mac branded stores with a field management and store management structure similar to that of our Video Game Brands stores. Vendors We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from over 80 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors accounted for approximately 96% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2015 .   Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Electronic Arts accounted for 27% , 19% , 11% and 10% , respectively, of our new product purchases during fiscal 2015 . We have established price protections with our primary vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Competition The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores compete with mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, among others, as well as other pre-paid and post-paid wireless carriers and their distribution channels, including Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our Simply Mac stores compete with mass-market retailers as noted above. Our Spring Mobile managed Cricket branded stores compete with the pre-paid and post-paid wireless service offerings of Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other prepaid brands including Boost, GoPhone and MetroPCS. 10 Table of Contents Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2015 , we generated approximately 38% of our sales during the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2014 , we generated approximately 37% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Spring Mobile,” “Simply Mac,” “Kongregate,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 20,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 30,000 and 62,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.

Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to goodwill impairments of $627.0 million resulting from our interim goodwill impairment tests performed during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment charges. (2) Results for fiscal 2015 include impairment charges of $4.6 million , comprised of $4.4 million of property and equipment impairments and $0.2 million of intangible asset impairments. Results for fiscal 2014 include impairment charges of $2.2 million, comprised of $1.9 million of property and equipment impairments and $0.3 million of intangible asset impairments. Results for fiscal 2013 include impairments of $18.5 million, of which $7.4 million and $2.1 million were related to certain technology assets and other intangible assets, respectively, as a result of our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs and the remaining $9.0 million was related to property and equipment impairments resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to asset impairments of $53.7 million, of which $44.9 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name and $8.8 million relates to other impairment charges from the evaluations of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2011 include charges related to asset impairments and restructuring charges of $81.2 million, of which $37.8 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name, $22.7 million relates to the impairment of investments in non-core businesses and $20.7 million relates to other impairments, termination benefits and facility closure costs. (3) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2016 compares the 52 weeks for the period ended January 30, 2016 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (4) On September 24, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured 5.50% 2019 Senior Notes. The 2019 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on April 1, 2015. The 2019 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and are not registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. The 2019 Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. See Note 10, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2019 Senior Notes. 26 Table of Contents

Our Strategy During the past few years, we have transformed from the world’s largest specialty retailer of physical video game products into a family of retail brands selling many of the world’s most popular technologies and pop-culture products. Our vision is to continue to expand our business as a global family of specialty retail brands.  Our mission is to continue to be the world’s largest omnichannel retailer of new and pre-owned and value video game products, to continue to grow sales of digital products, to expand the sales of collectible products through our video game stores and www.thinkgeek.com, to increase the number of our pop culture-themed stores and to strategically grow our Technology Brands segment to further diversify our revenue streams. Our goal is to have 50% or more of our operating earnings for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”) come from sources other than "physical gaming," which we define as our traditional revenue streams including new video game hardware, new video game software, pre-owned and value video game products, video game accessories, PC entertainment software, interactive game figures, strategy guides and revenue from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We have a broad-based executive management team with substantial experience in the retail sector in merchandising, marketing, supply chain management, store operations and real estate. Following on the success of extending our core competencies into our mobile business, our strategy is to leverage our management team and core competencies to identify other retail concepts that we can acquire and rapidly expand. We believe our core competencies include the following: • Real estate knowledge, including extensive relationships with landlords, portfolio management, negotiating skills and risk mitigation; • Human resource management, including hiring, training, systems and processes, particularly in multi-unit management of small, limited staffing, specialty retail stores with expert staff in assisted-selling; • Knowledge of buy-sell-trade programs, including pricing algorithms, inventory balancing, refurbishment capabilities and secondhand dealer laws; • Customer retention programs, including using our loyalty programs to drive consumer awareness of new retail concepts and promote new products; and • The ability to deploy capital in ways that diversify the underlying business, manage financial risk and increase shareholder value, including finding acquisitions that have a high return on invested capital and are accretive to earnings. Our competencies in real estate and human resource management stem from our experience in rapid growth retail environments. We have anchored our strategy and growth plans upon the following pillars: • Maximize brick and mortar stores. Our strategy regarding our retail stores includes growing our leading market share in video games, utilizing our stores to grow digital sales and applying our retail expertise to our Technology Brands businesses. Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We expect to open approximately 100 new stores in fiscal 2017, including approximately 35 collectibles stores and approximately 65 Technology Brands stores. Our strategy also includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring sales to other nearby GameStop locations. We plan to close approximately 130 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2017 and 55 Technology Brands stores. In our video game stores, we provide a high level of customer service by hiring game enthusiasts and providing them with ongoing sales training, including training in the latest technical and functional elements of our products and services, making them the most knowledgeable associates in the video game retail market. We focus marketing efforts and store associates on driving the sale of new release video game products, both physical and digital. As the world’s largest retailer of video game products with a proven capability to capture market share immediately following new product launches, we believe we regularly receive larger allocations of popular new video game products than our competitors. To assist our customers in obtaining immediate access to new releases, we offer our customers the opportunity to pre-order products in our stores or through our websites prior to their release. Our Technology Brands business centers around our long-term partnership with AT&T, under which we sell AT&T products and services in our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and certain AT&T products and services in our Simply Mac stores. We also have an agreement with Apple under which we sell Apple products and services in our Simply Mac stores. 3 Table of Contents We acquired Spring Mobile in November 2013. Spring Mobile has grown from approximately 90 AT&T branded stores at the end of 2012 to 1,403 stores as of January 28, 2017 , through a program with two primary focuses. The first of these is to acquire AT&T retailers. The second is opening what we refer to as “whitespace” stores, or new stores in retail locations identified by either AT&T or Spring Mobile management and agreed to by both parties. AT&T supports the opening of new whitespace stores by its authorized retailers in an effort to increase the size of its retail distribution channel. Both of these represent opportunities for continued growth in the near term for Spring Mobile. In connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands business, Spring Mobile completed acquisitions of several additional AT&T authorized retailers in fiscal 2016 , adding over 500 stores. In July 2015, we acquired ThinkGeek, an online and wholesale retailer and developer that sells pop culture themed collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers through the www.thinkgeek.com website and certain exclusive products to wholesale channel customers. The addition of ThinkGeek provides an expansion of our global omnichannel platform and enables us to broaden our product offering in the collectibles category, including standalone stores and deepen relationships with our existing customer base. We continue to seek opportunities to extend core competencies to other products and retail categories in order to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle. • Expand our pre-owned business. We believe we are the largest retailer of pre-owned video game products in the world and carry the broadest selection of pre-owned and value video game products for both current and previous generation platforms, giving us a unique advantage in the video game retail industry. The opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned video game products offers our customers a unique value proposition generally unavailable at most mass merchants, toy stores and consumer electronics retailers. We obtain most of our pre-owned video game products from trade-ins made in our stores by our customers. Pre-owned and value video game products generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our strategy consists of continuing to expand our product assortment to drive sales and gross profit growth, increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of trading in and buying pre-owned video game products through increased marketing activities and the use of both broad and targeted marketing to our loyalty program members. The supply of trade-ins of video game products, and the demand for resale of these products, is affected by overall demand for video game products and the introduction of new software and hardware by our suppliers. We expect the March 2017 launch of the Nintendo Switch and the continued adoption of next-generation consoles and software to drive trade-ins of video game products, thereby expanding our supply of pre-owned video game products. Our Simply Mac stores also offer customers the opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned Apple products. • Own the customer . Sustaining and growing our existing customer base depends on our ability to increase GameStop brand awareness, to drive membership in our loyalty programs, to engage with customers online, through social media and our mobile apps, and to expand our market leadership position by offering a variety of new and pre-owned video game products and continuing to enhance our mobile and digital product and service offerings. We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had over 36 million members as of January 28, 2017 . Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 16 million members as of January 28, 2017 . Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products. Approximately 6 million of the 36 million U.S. loyalty members were paying members. Our e-commerce sites allow our customers to buy games online, reserve or pick up merchandise in our stores, order in-store for home delivery and to learn about the latest video game products and their availability in our stores. Together, our loyalty programs, websites, mobile applications, magazine and other properties are a part of our omnichannel retail strategy designed to enhance our relationships with our customers, making it easier for our customers to transact with us and increase loyalty. Our store personnel provide value-added services to each customer, such as maintaining lists of regular customers and reserving new releases for customers with a down payment to ensure product availability. In addition, our store personnel readily provide product reviews and ratings to ensure customers are making informed purchasing decisions and inform customers of available resources, including Game Informer and our e-commerce sites, to increase a customer’s enjoyment of the product upon purchase. • Expand our digital growth strategy . Growth in the video game industry in recent years has been fueled by the proliferation of online game play, the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of digital gaming. The recent generations of video game consoles contain the technology to digitally download video game software content and a growing percentage of new games are being sold digitally (which the video game industry refers to as "full-game downloads"). Additionally, a growing market exists for the sale of digitally downloadable add-on content for physical games, which the video game industry refers to as “DLC.” The digital game market also consists of both immersive and casual games delivered over the internet to computers, tablets, smart phones and other devices. We sell a variety of digitally downloadable content in our video game stores and on our websites, including DLC, full-game downloads, network points cards, prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We believe we are the only significant brick-and-mortar retail seller of DLC and that we are frequently the leading seller of DLC for most major game titles. 4 Table of Contents • Maintain a disciplined capital allocation . Our objective in recent years has been to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends unless more strategic opportunities arise that we believe would create more meaningful shareholder returns. In fiscal 2016 , we paid dividends of $1.48 per share of Class A Common Stock, totaling $155.5 million for the year.  Additionally, on February 28, 2017 , our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend to $1.52 per share of Class A Common Stock, with the first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2017 of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock, payable on March 28, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 14, 2017 . In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price per share of $24.94 for a total of $75.1 million . In order to create more meaningful shareholder returns, as we evaluate investments in strategic opportunities, we target internal rates of return (“IRR”) in excess of 20% for whitespace store expansion and acquisitions. The total consideration of the completed acquisitions of additional AT&T authorized retailers in fiscal 2016 was $483.5 million net of cash acquired, which includes $43.2 million estimated contingent consideration. Market Size Video Game Products. Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD") and International Development Group ("IDG"), we estimate that the market for new physical video game products was approximately $17 billion in 2016 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $13 billion and $22 billion in 2016 . Mobile and Consumer Electronics. The mobile and consumer electronics market, as we refer to it, consists primarily of wireless services, new and pre-owned mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, consumer electronics such as Apple products and services, non-gaming headsets and accessories. The market for wireless devices and services is estimated by CTIA — The Wireless Association ® to exceed $190 billion. We expect that the market for AT&T services and products and the wireless market in general will continue to grow as more and more devices connect to the internet through wireless networks and as AT&T continues to broaden its offerings of content and services, such as DIRECTV. Merchandise We categorize our sale of products and services as follows: • New Video Game Hardware. We offer the video game platforms of all major manufacturers, including the Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch, Wii U, and DS line. We also offer extended service agreements on video game hardware and software. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. We are in a console cycle which began with the Nintendo Wii U launch in November 2012 and the launches of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. In March 2017, Nintendo introduced the Switch. We believe that selling video game hardware increases store traffic and promotes customer loyalty, leading to increased sales of video game software and accessories, which have higher gross margins than video game hardware. • New Video Game Software. We purchase new video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision. We are one of the largest customers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We generally carry approximately 570 SKUs of new video game software at any given time across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. • Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection (approximately 3,000 SKUs) of pre-owned video game titles which have an average price of $24 as compared to an average price of $46 for new video game titles and which generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our highly-customized inventory management system allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and to reallocate our inventory as necessary. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. • Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. • Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as full-game downloads and DLC, for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency and we have developed technology to sell 5 Table of Contents DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency and DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. • Technology Brands. Technology Brands consist primarily of wireless products, services and accessories and consumer electronics offered in our Technology Brands segment through Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and Simply Mac stores. This product category also includes Apple and other consumer electronics products. • Collectibles .  Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop culture themes which are sold through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com. • Other Products. Other products primarily consist of PC entertainment software, gaming-related print media, mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments, and revenues from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and interactive game figures, such as Amiibos from Nintendo and Skylanders from Activision. The products in our Video Games Brands segments are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise being the timing of release of new products in the various geographies and language translations. Our in-store video game product inventory generally consists of a constantly changing selection averaging over 5,700 SKUs. We have buying groups in each of our segments that negotiate terms, discounts and cooperative advertising allowances for the stores in their respective geographic areas. We use customer requests and feedback, pre-orders, industry magazines and product reviews to determine which new releases are expected to be hits. Pre-orders are tracked at individual stores to distribute titles and capture demand effectively. This merchandise management is essential because a significant portion of a game’s sales are usually generated in the first days and weeks following its release. Store Operations We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,500 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us. Our Technology Brands stores vary in size, with an average size of approximately 1,900 square feet. Our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores carry wireless products and accessories, and our Simply Mac stores carry Apple and other consumer electronics. Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Site Selection and Locations Site Selection. Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores are selected after approval from AT&T. Simply Mac stores are selected with input from Apple. In each of our geographic segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations. 6 Table of Contents Domestic Locations.

Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fourth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2016 issue, the magazine had approximately 6.0 million paid subscribers, including approximately 2.3 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Omnichannel We operate e-commerce sites in eight countries, under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek, that allow our customers to buy video game products, collectibles and other merchandise online. Customers can reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. The sites also offer customers information and content about available games, release dates for upcoming games, and access to store information, such as location and product availability. E-commerce results are included in the geographic segment where the sales originate. Additionally, with the GameStop mobile app, smart phone users can browse our extensive product selection and experience an enhanced PowerUp Rewards dashboard. We estimate that the GameStop mobile app has been installed over 8 million times. Kongregate We operate Kongregate, which is a leading web and mobile gaming platform that has attracted over 5.2 billion web gameplays and over 2.5 billion mobile gameplays since its launch. Kongregate is also a publisher of mobile games and has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores, which have received over 110 million mobile installs. Over 34,000 developers have uploaded more than 112,000 games to www.kongregate.com. The majority of Kongregate’s revenues come from its mobile apps and in-game transactions utilizing a proprietary virtual currency called Kreds. Kongregate’s mobile publishing division has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores. Advertising Given the high foot traffic drawn past our stores, we use in-store marketing efforts such as window displays and “coming soon” signs to attract customers, as well as to promote our products. Inside our stores, we feature selected products through the use of vendor displays, “coming soon” or preview videos, signs, catalogs, point-of-purchase materials and end-cap displays. These advertising efforts are designed to increase the initial sales of new titles upon their release. On a global basis, we receive cooperative advertising and market development funds from most of our manufacturers, distributors, software publishers and accessory suppliers to promote their respective products. Generally, vendors agree to purchase advertising space in one of our advertising vehicles. Once we run the advertising, the vendor pays us an agreed amount. Our loyalty programs are designed to incent our customers to shop more often at our stores and to allow us to market directly to our customers based on their individual tastes and preferences. Our loyalty programs provide members with the opportunity to earn unique video game related rewards not available through any other retailer. Vendors also participate in these programs to increase the sales of their individual products. In the last several years, as part of our brand-building efforts and targeted growth strategies, we expanded our advertising and promotional activities in certain targeted markets at key times of the year. In addition, we expanded our use of television and radio advertising in certain markets to promote brand awareness, our pre-owned business and store openings. We expect our investment in advertising to increase in certain areas to support our targeted growth strategies. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Distribution. We operate distribution facilities in various locations throughout the world, with each location strategically located to support the operations in a particular country or region. In order to enhance our first-to-market distribution network, we also utilize the services of several off-site, third-party operated distribution centers that pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. Inventory is shipped to each store at least twice a week, or daily, if necessary, in order to keep stores in supply of products. Our distribution facilities also typically support refurbishment of pre-owned products to be redistributed to our stores. 8 Table of Contents We distribute products to our U.S. stores and on-line customers through a 353,000 square foot distribution center in Grapevine, Texas and a 631,000 square foot distribution center in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. The technology used in the distribution centers allows for high-volume receiving and distributions to stores. We distribute merchandise to our Canadian segment from two distribution centers in Brampton, Ontario. We have a distribution center near Brisbane, Australia which supports our Australian operations and a small distribution facility in New Zealand which supports the stores in New Zealand. European segment operations are supported by four regionally-located distribution centers in Milan, Italy; Memmingen, Germany; Dublin, Ireland; and Paris, France. Digital Distribution. We have developed proprietary technology to work in conjunction with developers, as well as Microsoft and Sony, to enable us to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our e-commerce sites. Management Information Systems. Our proprietary inventory management systems and point-of-sale technology show daily sales and in-store stock by title by store. Our systems use this data to automatically generate replenishment shipments to each store from our distribution centers, enabling each store to carry a merchandise assortment uniquely tailored to its own sales mix and rate of sale. Our call lists and reservation system also provide our buying staff with information to determine order size and inventory management for store-by-store inventory allocation. To support most of our operations, we use a large-scale, Intel-based computing environment with a state-of-the-art storage area network and a wired and wireless corporate network installed at our U.S. and regional international headquarters, and a secure, virtual private network to access and provide services to computing assets located in our stores, distribution centers and satellite offices and to our mobile workforce. This strategy has proven to minimize initial outlay of capital while allowing for flexibility and growth as operations expand. Regional communication links exist to each of our distribution centers and offices in international locations with connectivity to our U.S. data center as required by our international, distributed applications. Our proprietary point-of-sale system has been enhanced to facilitate trade-in transactions, including automatic look-up of trade-in prices and printing of machine-readable bar codes to facilitate in-store restocking of pre-owned video games. In addition, our central database of all pre-owned and value video game products allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and reallocate our pre-owned and value video game products as necessary. Field Management and Staff Each of our Video Game Brands stores employs, on average, one store leader, one assistant store leader and between two and ten sales associates, many of whom are part-time employees. Each store leader is responsible for managing their personnel and the economic performance of their store. We have cultivated a work environment that attracts employees who are actively interested in video games so that they are better able to assist customers. To encourage them to sell the full range of our products and to maximize our profitability, we provide our employees with targeted incentive programs to drive overall sales and sales of higher margin products. Our stores communicate with our corporate offices daily via e-mail. This e-mail allows for better tracking of trends in upcoming titles, competitor strategies and in-stock inventory positions and the opportunity to communicate directly with our executives. We have invested in significant management training programs for our store leaders and our district leaders to enhance their business management skills. We also sponsor our annual store leaders’ conferences at which we conduct intense educational training programs to provide our video game store employees with information about the upcoming video game products that will be released by publishers during the holiday season. All video game software publishers and vendors are invited to attend the conferences. Our Video Game Brands store operations are managed by market vice presidents or managing directors (in the case of international markets) who directly supervise regional leaders. The regions are further divided into districts, each with a district leader covering an average of 15 stores. Our Technology Brands segment is managed by a senior vice president who manages a vice president for each of our three store concepts. We operate the AT&T branded, Cricket branded and Simply Mac branded stores with a field management and store management structure similar to that of our Video Game Brands stores. Vendors We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from approximately 90 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors in our Video Game Brands segments accounted for approximately 78% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2016 . Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Activision accounted for 24% , 14% , 10% , 7% and 6% , respectively, of our new product purchases in our Video Game Brands segments during fiscal 2016 . We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase substantially all of our products in our Technology Brands segment through our agreements with AT&T and Apple. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. 9 Table of Contents Competition The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores compete with mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, among others, as well as other pre-paid and post-paid wireless carriers and their distribution channels, including Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our Simply Mac stores compete with mass-market retailers as noted above. Our Spring Mobile managed Cricket branded stores compete with the pre-paid and post-paid wireless service offerings of Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other prepaid brands including Boost, GoPhone and MetroPCS. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2016 and 2015 , we generated approximately 35% and 38% , respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Spring Mobile,” “Simply Mac,” “Kongregate,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 23,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 30,000 and 45,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit. Sustainability We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2016 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over 8 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 3.9 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled almost 3 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure, and look for cost-effective ways to reduce, our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past five years.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report, before you make an investment decision with respect to our company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Economic conditions in the U.S. and in certain international markets could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing video game products, when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of the Company's control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and civil disturbances. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The video game industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business. The video game industry has historically been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. In addition, the features of new consoles or changes to the existing generations of consoles, including any future restrictions or conditions or the ability to play prior generation video games on such consoles, may adversely affect our pre-owned business. The current generation console cycle began when Sony and Microsoft  launched the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. Nintendo introduced the Switch in March 2017. If the current video game platforms do not continue to be successful, our sales of video game products could decline. The introduction of next-generation consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business, which could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. We depend upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors. We depend on major hardware manufacturers, primarily Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, to deliver new and existing video game platforms and new innovations on a timely basis and in anticipated quantities. In addition, we depend on software publishers to introduce new and updated software titles. We have experienced sales declines in the past due to a reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms or software titles could result in reduced sales. If we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. The interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. The popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming has increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile 11 Table of Contents and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to respond to this growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming and transition our business to take advantage of these new forms of gaming. We have been and are currently pursuing various strategies to integrate these new forms of gaming into our business model, but we can provide no assurances that these strategies will be successful or profitable. In order to continue to compete effectively in the video game industry, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers’ preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to keep pace with these changes. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower our sales. The current consoles from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. Downloading of video game content to the current generation video game systems continues to grow and take an increasing percentage of new video game sales, despite possible constraints caused by bandwidth capacity and video game file sizes. If consumers' preference for downloading video game content continues to increase or these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers’ ability to access and download the current format of video games and incremental content for their games through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase video games in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of game delivery. As a result, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers may impact our financial results. Our financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors. Our largest vendors in our Video Game Brands segments are Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Activision, which accounted for 24% , 14% , 10% , 7% and 6% , respectively, of our new product purchases in fiscal 2016 . If our suppliers do not provide us with favorable business terms, we may not be able to offer products to our customers at competitive prices. If our vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted. The manufacturers of video game hardware and software have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. Additionally, AT&T and Apple provide our Technology Brands stores with similar support.  As part of this support, we receive cooperative advertising and market development payments from these vendors which enable us to actively promote and merchandise the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. We cannot assure you that vendors will continue to provide this support at historical levels. If they fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. The continued growth of our Technology Brands segment is dependent in large part on our relationship with AT&T and any material adverse change to this relationship would affect our results. We continue to grow our Technology Brands segment as a way to diversify our business in order to continue to drive growth and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console business. Gross margins in our Technology Brands segment are higher than in our Video Game Brands segments and as a result, a growing portion of our profits is due to the growth of our Technology Brands segment. Our Technology Brands segment is primarily conducted through Spring Mobile, an AT&T authorized retailer currently operating 1,403 AT&T branded stores selling post-paid wireless services and products, and 69 Cricket branded stores selling pre-paid wireless services and products. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with AT&T for the continued growth of our Technology Brands segment. In particular, we depend on AT&T for constant innovation and the timely delivery of products and services to our stores. Any material adverse change in our relationship with AT&T, including termination of the relationship (which is permissible upon a short notice period), the lack of innovation or failure to timely supply products or competitive service plans, or changes in the manner in which AT&T compensates its authorized retailers, could materially adversely impact the continued growth of our Technology Brands segment and our financial condition and results of operations. Our growing relationship with AT&T could have an adverse impact on our business, including as a result of restrictions on our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses. We are a significant reseller of AT&T products and services through our Technology Brands segment. We also sell certain AT&T products and services through our Video Game Brands stores. Our agreements with AT&T and its affiliates impose significant restrictions on our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses, including several that are adjacent to markets in which we participate or are considering entering, which could materially adversely impact this component of our business. 12 Table of Contents We have made and may make investments and acquisitions which could negatively impact our business if we fail to successfully complete and integrate them, or if they fail to perform in accordance with our expectations. To enhance our efforts to grow and compete, we have made and continue to make investments and acquisitions. These activities include investments in and acquisitions of digital, browser, social and mobile gaming and technology-based companies as the delivery methods for video games continue to evolve, and investments in new retail categories like wireless and consumer electronics. Our plans to pursue future transactions are subject to our ability to identify potential candidates and negotiate favorable terms for these transactions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that future investments or acquisitions will be completed. In addition, to facilitate future transactions, we may take actions that could dilute the equity interests of our stockholders, increase our debt or cause us to assume contingent liabilities, all of which may have a detrimental effect on the price of our common stock. Also, companies that we have acquired, and that we may acquire in the future, could have products that are in development, and there is no assurance that these products will be successfully developed. Finally, if any acquisitions are not successfully integrated with our business, or fail to perform in accordance with our expectations, our ongoing operations could be adversely affected. Integration of digital, browser, social and mobile gaming and mobile phone and technology-based companies or other retailers may be particularly challenging to us as these companies are outside of our historical operating expertise. Pressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which could decrease our profitability. The retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Wal-Mart and Target; computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy; internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com; other U.S. and international video game and PC software specialty stores located in malls and other locations, such as Carrefour and Media Markt; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and may have greater financial resources than we do or other advantages. In addition, video game products and content are increasingly being digitally distributed and new competitors built to take advantage of these new capabilities are entering the marketplace, and other methods may emerge in the future. We also compete with other sellers of pre-owned video game products and other PC software distribution companies, including Steam. Certain of our mass-merchant competitors are expanding in the market for pre-owned video games through aggressive pricing which may negatively affect our margins, sales and earnings for these products.  Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including browser, social and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. Our Technology Brands stores compete with a wide variety of other wireless carriers and retailers and consumer electronics retailers, including AT&T, which competes with our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, we may be less profitable. We depend upon our key personnel and they would be difficult to replace. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Additionally, we depend upon the continued services of our key executive officers, including our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice Presidents. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or our failure to retain key employees in the future may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers. Our continued success depends upon customers' perception of our Company. Any negative publicity relating to our vendors, products, practices or our Company could damage our reputation. The increased use of social media platforms allows for the rapid disbursement of information, including negative feedback or other commentary, which could negatively impact our reputation and result in declines in customer loyalty and adversely affect our results of operations. International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. Our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Our international operations expose us to numerous risks. We have international retail operations in Australia, Canada and Europe. Because release schedules for hardware and software introduction in these markets can sometimes differ from release schedules in the United States, the timing of increases and decreases in foreign sales may differ from the timing of increases and decreases in domestic sales. We are also subject to a number of other factors that may affect our current or future international operations. These include: • economic downturns, specifically in the regions in which we operate; • currency exchange rate fluctuations; • international incidents; • natural disasters; • government instability; and • competitors entering our current and potential markets. Our operations in Europe are also subject to risks associated with the current economic conditions and uncertainties in the European Union (“EU”). In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the exit of that country from the EU (“Brexit”), and the British government has indicated that it intends to negotiate a withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU. The Brexit vote has created significant economic uncertainty in Europe. In addition, European and global economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the inability of certain EU member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. There continues to be uncertainty over the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles, the ultimate outcome of the EU governments’ financial support programs, the possible breakup or restructuring of the EU and the possible elimination or restructuring of the EU monetary system. These continued uncertainties could further disrupt European and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products. These factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business. Changes to tariff and import/export regulations may negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. The United States and other countries have occasionally proposed and enacted protectionist trade policies that could increase the cost or reduce the availability of certain merchandise.  In particular, the current U.S. administration has made comments supporting potential changes to import/export tariffs and international trade agreements and there is political discussion regarding the implementation of a “border adjustment tax.”  Any of these measures, if implemented, could have an adverse impact on our business because a significant portion of the products we offer are purchased from foreign vendors and manufactured in foreign countries. Unfavorable changes in our global tax rate could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be higher than other companies or higher than our tax rates have been in the past. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our business and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. A change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any jurisdiction in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of our operations. Restrictions on our ability to take trade-ins of and sell pre-owned video game products or pre-owned mobile devices could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results depend on our ability to take trade-ins of, and sell, pre-owned video game products and pre-owned mobile devices within our stores. Actions by manufacturers or publishers of video game products or mobile devices, wireless carriers or governmental authorities to prohibit or limit our ability to take trade-ins or sell pre-owned video game products or mobile devices, or to limit the ability of consumers to play pre-owned video games or use pre-owned mobile devices, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Sales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and our financial results may be adversely affected as a result. Many popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an “M” or “T” rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations. An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2016, we generated approximately 35% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • the timing of new store openings or closings; • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; and • changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. Failure to effectively manage our new store openings could lower our sales and profitability. Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We opened 73 Video Game Brands stores (including 52 collectibles stores) and opened or acquired 583 Technology Brands stores in fiscal 2016 . We expect to open approximately 100 new stores in fiscal 2017 , including approximately 35 collectibles stores and approximately 65 Technology Brands stores. Our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include: • the ability to identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost efficient manner; • the ability to hire and train skilled associates; • the ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations; and • the ability to increase sales at new store locations. If we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease. Failure to successfully execute our strategy to close stores and transfer customers and sales to nearby stores could adversely impact our financial results. Our strategy includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring sales to other nearby GameStop locations. We closed 141 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2016 and plan to close approximately 130 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2017 . We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. 15 Table of Contents If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue may be adversely affected. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion. We rely on centralized facilities for refurbishment of our pre-owned products. Any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on centralized facilities for the refurbishment of all pre-owned products that we sell. If any disruption occurred at these facilities, whether due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, systems failures, or other unforeseen causes, sales of our pre-owned products could decrease. Since we generally obtain higher margins on our pre-owned products, any adverse effect on their sales could adversely affect our profitability. If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our distribution centers, as well as to communicate distribution information to the off-site, third-party operated distribution centers with which we work. The third-party distribution centers pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles and deliver them to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores at least twice a week, to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Data breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues. We store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons.  Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Consequently, despite our efforts, our security measures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber-attack, team member error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement or other acts; and unauthorized parties have in the past obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our customers’ data. While costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant, any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and, possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace. Also, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance. Litigation and the outcomes of such litigation could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various litigation and legal proceedings, including matters involving wage and hour employee class actions, stockholder and consumer class actions, tax audits and unclaimed property audits by states. The outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and the magnitude of potential losses therefrom, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Certain of these legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may require changes to our business operations that negatively impact our operating results or involve significant liability awards that impact our financial condition. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. As a result, legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 16 Table of Contents Legislative actions and changes in accounting rules may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase and impact our future financial condition and results of operations. In order to comply with laws adopted by the U.S. government or other U.S. or foreign regulatory bodies, we may be required to increase our expenditures and hire additional personnel and additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase. Significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment affecting Medicare reimbursements, product safety, supply chain transparency, and increased compliance costs related to enforcement of federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law related to overtime, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. Environmental legislation or other regulatory changes could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global retailer. Specifically, environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, and water or product materials are continually being explored by governing bodies. Increasing energy and fuel costs, supply chain disruptions and other potential risks to our business, as well as any significant rule making or passage of any such legislation, could materially increase the cost to transport our goods and materially adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, regulatory and enforcement activity focused on the retail industry has increased in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operational costs associated with compliance. As a seller of certain consumer products, we are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, and statutes relating to product safety and consumer protection. While we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations. Our Board of Directors could change our dividend policy at any time. We initiated our first cash dividend on our common stock during fiscal 2012. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Certain provisions in our credit facility and covenants under the indentures for our 5.50% Senior Notes due October 1, 2019 (the “2019 Senior Notes”) and our 6.75% Senior Notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes" and, together, the “Senior Notes”), restrict our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances. In addition, subject to any financial covenants in current or future financing agreements that directly or indirectly restrict our ability to pay dividends, the payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our future earnings and cash flow from operations, our capital requirements, our financial condition and any other factors that the Board of Directors may consider. Unless we continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon its future appreciation. Our common stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased. We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our results of operations. In recent periods, we have recorded non-cash charges relating to the impairment of tangible and intangible assets that had an adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Risks Relating to Indebtedness Because of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our senior credit facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents The terms of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The terms of our Senior Notes and our senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us in certain circumstances. These restrictions, among other things, limit our ability to: • incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guaranty obligations; • incur liens or agree to negative pledges in other agreements; • engage in sale and leaseback transactions; • make loans and investments; • declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock; • engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations; • prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; • amend or otherwise alter the terms of our organizational documents and indebtedness; • sell assets; and • engage in transactions with affiliates. We cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities and may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures for the Senior Notes, or under our senior credit facility, could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applied. In addition, an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made under our senior credit facility or to holders of our Senior Notes, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or if that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments, then in effect. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those sales and raise debt or equity to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance would also depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage. We are able to incur additional indebtedness. Although our senior credit facility and the indentures for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Such future indebtedness or obligations may have restrictions similar to, or more restrictive than, those included in the indentures for our Senior Notes or our senior credit facility. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to goodwill impairments of $627.0 million resulting from our interim goodwill impairment tests performed during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. (2) Results for fiscal 2016 include impairment charges of $33.8 million , comprised of a $7.4 million impairment to our Micromania trade name, a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreements and $19.4 million of property and equipment impairments. Results for fiscal 2015 include impairment charges of $4.6 million , comprised of $4.4 million of property and equipment impairments and $0.2 million of intangible asset impairments. Results for fiscal 2014 include impairment charges of $2.2 million, comprised of $1.9 million of property and equipment impairments and $0.3 million of intangible asset impairments. Results for fiscal 2013 include impairments of $18.5 million, of which $7.4 million and $2.1 million were related to certain technology assets and other intangible assets, respectively, as a result of our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs and the remaining $9.0 million was related to property and equipment impairments resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to asset impairments of $53.7 million, of which $44.9 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name and $8.8 million relates to other impairment charges from the evaluations of store property, equipment and other assets. (3) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for fiscal year 2016 compares the 52 weeks for the period ended January 28, 2017 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (4) In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted Accounting Standard Update 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As a result, we have recast the fiscal 2015 and 2014 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," for additional information. (5) In March 2016, we issued $475 million aggregate principal of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due in March 2021. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal of 5.50% unsecured senior notes due in October 2019. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 23 Table of Contents

Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a global family of specialty retail brands. Through our 6,013 video game brand stores and e-commerce sites in eight countries, we are the world's largest omnichannel retailer of video game products. We also offer wireless products and services and consumer technology products through our 1,403 AT&T authorized retailer stores, 69 Cricket pre-paid wireless stores and 50 Simply Mac stores, a certified reseller of Apple consumer electronic products. In addition, we are a leading retailer of collectible pop-culture themed products. We have five reportable segments, which are comprised of four geographic Video Game Brands segments—United States, Canada, Australia and Europe—and a Technology Brands segment. Our Technology Brands segment includes our Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses. Spring Mobile owns and operates our AT&T branded wireless retail stores and Cricket branded pre-paid wireless stores. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2016 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2017 ("fiscal 2016"). Fiscal year 2015 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2015"). Fiscal year 2014 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2014"). Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. Gaming consoles are typically launched in cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in graphics, audio quality, game play, internet connectivity and other entertainment capabilities beyond video gaming. The current generation of consoles (the Sony PlayStation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One) was introduced in 2013. In August and November 2016, Microsoft and Sony released refreshes to the current generation of consoles. Additionally, Sony introduced its virtual reality hardware, PlayStation VR, in October 2016 and Nintendo introduced its new console, Nintendo Switch, in March 2017. We expect that future growth in the video game industry will also be driven by the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of gaming. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), full-game downloads, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We have made significant investments in e-commerce and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to access digital content easily and facilitate the digital sales and delivery process. We plan to continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category. We continue to diversify our business by seeking out opportunities to extend our core competencies to other businesses and retail categories, including mobile and consumer electronics and collectibles, to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle and regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material. From fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2016, we have grown our store count of AT&T authorized retailers by 1,239 stores, primarily through acquisitions. In 2014, we introduced stand-alone collectibles stores and expanded the selection of collectible products in our stores. To further expand our collectibles business, we acquired ThinkGeek in 2015, and we plan to continue investing in this category going forward. We continue to seek to invest in other retail concepts and product lines with the intention of further diversifying our business. In our discussion of the results of operations, we refer to comparable store sales which is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for fiscal year 2016 compares the 52 weeks for the period ended January 28, 2017 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. 24 Table of Contents STORE COUNT INFORMATION The following table presents the number of stores and the number of stores opened, acquired and closed during fiscal 2016: January 30, 2016 Opened/Acquired Closed January 28, 2017 Video Game Stores 6,046 21 (140 ) 5,927 Collectibles Stores 35 52 (1 ) 86 Total Video Game Brands 6,081 73 (141 ) 6,013 Spring Mobile 890 575 (62 ) 1,403 Cricket 70 8 (9 ) 69 Simply Mac 76 — (26 ) 50 Total Technology Brands 1,036 583 (97 ) 1,522 Total Stores 7,117 656 (238 ) 7,535 SEASONALITY Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain statement of operations items (in millions) and as a percentage of net sales, for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Net sales $ 8,607.9 100.0 % $ 9,363.8 100.0 % $ 9,296.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 5,598.6 65.0 6,445.5 68.8 6,520.1 70.1 Gross profit 3,009.3 35.0 2,918.3 31.2 2,775.9 29.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,252.6 26.2 2,108.9 22.6 2,001.0 21.6 Depreciation and amortization 165.2 1.9 156.6 1.7 154.4 1.7 Asset impairments 33.8 0.4 4.6 — 2.2 — Operating earnings 557.7 6.5 648.2 6.9 618.3 6.6 Interest expense, net 53.0 0.6 23.0 0.2 10.0 0.1 Earnings before income tax expense 504.7 5.9 625.2 6.7 608.3 6.5 Income tax expense 151.5 1.8 222.4 2.4 215.2 2.3 Net income $ 353.2 4.1 % $ 402.8 4.3 % $ 393.1 4.2 % We include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations. We include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales in the statement of operations. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of these classifications as a percentage of sales has not historically been material. In fiscal 2016, we revised the classification of sales and gross profit of mobile and consumer electronics and other when presenting financial information for significant product categories. Prior to these revisions, we presented a product category labeled "mobile and consumer electronics" which was comprised of mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments and Technology Brands segment. We also included sales and gross profit of collectibles in "Other." In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, sales and gross profit of mobile and consumer electronics generated by our Technology Brands segment are separately presented as "Technology Brands" and sales and gross profit of mobile and consumer electronics generated by our Video Game Brands segments are included in "Other." In addition, sales and gross profit of collectibles are separately presented as "Collectibles." 25 Table of Contents We believe this presentation of our product categories is more meaningful to our investors considering (i) gross margins of mobile and consumer electronics in our Technology Brands segment differ from our Video Game Brands segments and (ii) sales of collectibles have grown significantly. Sales and gross profit data for prior periods have been recast to the current period presentation. The following tables set forth, by significant product category, net sales and gross profit information for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 Net Sales Percent of Total Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales New video game hardware (1) $ 1,396.7 16.2 % $ 1,944.7 20.8 % $ 2,028.7 21.8 % New video game software 2,493.4 29.0 2,905.1 31.0 3,089.0 33.2 Pre-owned and value video game products 2,254.1 26.2 2,374.7 25.4 2,389.3 25.7 Video game accessories 676.7 7.9 703.0 7.5 653.6 7.1 Digital 181.0 2.1 188.3 2.0 216.3 2.3 Technology Brands (2) 814.0 9.5 534.0 5.7 328.6 3.5 Collectibles 494.1 5.7 309.7 3.3 75.8 0.8 Other (3) 297.9 3.4 404.3 4.3 514.7 5.6 Total $ 8,607.9 100.0 % $ 9,363.8 100.0 % $ 9,296.0 100.0 % Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent New video game hardware (1) $ 154.2 11.0 % $ 175.5 9.0 % $ 196.6 9.7 % New video game software 600.4 24.1 689.3 23.7 716.9 23.2 Pre-owned and value video game products 1,044.1 46.3 1,114.5 46.9 1,146.3 48.0 Video game accessories 235.2 34.8 255.5 36.3 246.1 37.7 Digital 155.5 85.9 149.6 79.4 152.0 70.3 Technology Brands (2) 554.6 68.1 306.6 57.4 169.1 51.5 Collectibles 171.6 34.7 116.6 37.6 31.9 42.1 Other (3) 93.7 31.5 110.7 27.4 117.0 22.7 Total $ 3,009.3 35.0 % $ 2,918.3 31.2 % $ 2,775.9 29.9 % ___________________ (1) Includes sales of hardware bundles, in which physical hardware and digital or physical software are sold together as a single SKU.

The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales of 11.0% compared to the prior year. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of video game hardware and software. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales in Technology Brands and collectibles as a result of the Company's diversification efforts. The decrease in net sales was due to the following: • New video game hardware sales decreased $548.0 million , or 28.2% , for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decline in the quantity of hardware units sold combined with a reduction in selling price of certain models as the console cycle matures. • New video game software sales decreased $411.7 million , or 14.2% , for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to weaker new title releases in the current year. • Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased $120.6 million , or 5.1% , for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles and hardware unit sales declines in the current year. • Other sales decreased $106.4 million , or 26.3% , for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the decline in sales of interactive game figures and mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands stores. The decreases described above were partially offset by the following: • Technology Brands sales increased $280.0 million , or 52.4% , for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the acquisition and opening of Spring Mobile managed AT&T stores within the Technology Brands segment. • Collectibles sales increased $184.4 million , or 59.5% , for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, due to the acquisition of ThinkGeek in July 2015, the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased $846.9 million , or 13.1% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $91.0 million , or 3.1% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to 31.2% in fiscal 2015 . The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by our diversification efforts through the growth of Technology Brands and collectibles. Gross profit from Technology Brands increased $248.0 million , mainly due to growth through acquisitions and new store openings, and gross profit from collectibles increased by $55.0 million . In addition, gross profit from digital increased by $5.9 million . These increases were partially offset by decreases primarily in new video game software of $88.9 million , pre-owned and value video game products of $70.4 million , new video game hardware of $21.3 million , video game accessories of $20.3 million and other of $17.0 million . The net increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories as our Technology Brands and collectibles categories continue to grow and the following product margin rate variances: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on Technology Brands sales increased to 68.1% in fiscal 2016 from 57.4% in fiscal 2015 due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores which carry higher margins than the other businesses inside Technology Brands. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on digital sales increased to 85.9% in fiscal 2016 from 79.4% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of sales and the related commissions on the digital products we sold. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales of other products increased to 31.5% in fiscal 2016 from 27.4% in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by higher gross margin in mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands stores. The increases described above were partially offset by the following: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on collectibles decreased to 34.7% in fiscal 2016 from 37.6% in fiscal 2015, due to the addition of the ThinkGeek.com business in July 2015 which carries higher fulfillment costs compared to our in-store sales. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on video game accessories decreased to 34.8% in fiscal 2016 from 36.3% in fiscal 2015, due to the introduction of the PlayStation VR in fiscal 2016, which carries a lower gross margin than other accessory products. 28 Table of Contents • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 46.3% in fiscal 2016 from 46.9% in fiscal 2015 due to a greater mix of sales of current generation products, which carry lower gross margin than previous generation products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased $143.7 million , or 6.8% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The growth of Technology Brands contributed $195.2 million to the increase of SG&A, primarily driven by the addition of 486 stores when compared to the prior year and a higher SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to our Video Game Brands segments. The increase in SG&A related to Technology Brands includes store closure costs totaling $19.8 million in fiscal 2016, primarily associated with consolidating the Technology Brands segment store portfolio following increased acquisition activity. These increases were partially offset by a $31.9 million decrease to incentive compensation in our Video Game Brands segments, various cost reduction efforts and $7.4 million in acquisition-related costs associated with ThinkGeek incurred in the prior year. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.6 million , or 5.5% , in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 . This increase was primarily due to the acquisition and opening of stores in our Technology Brands segment. Asset Impairments During fiscal 2016, we recognized asset impairment charges totaling $33.8 million . These charges consisted of $19.4 million in impairments to store-level property and equipment, a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name intangible asset, and a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset. The Micromania trade name is associated with our operations in France. The property and equipment impairments were primarily related to our Technology Brands segment. In fiscal 2015, we recognized asset impairment charges totaling $4.6 million , primarily related to store-level property and equipment impairments in our Video Game Brands segments. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of $53.0 million for fiscal 2016 increased $30.0 million from $23.0 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the $475.0 million issuance of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 in March 2016, which is further discussed in Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements. Income Tax Income tax expense was $151.5 million , representing an effective tax rate of 30.0% in fiscal 2016 , compared to $222.4 million , representing an effective tax rate of 35.6% in fiscal 2015 . The decrease in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the recognition of tax benefits related to our adoption of a plan of reorganization specific to certain foreign operations, which resulted in our ability to recognize the benefit of foreign net operating losses that were previously unrecognized, partially offset by increases in our valuation allowance, changes in uncertain tax positions and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Operating Earnings and Net Income The factors described above led to operating earnings of $557.7 million for fiscal 2016 , or a 14.0% decrease from operating earnings of $ 648.2 million for fiscal 2015 . Additionally, net income was $353.2 million for fiscal 2016 , which represented a 12.3% decrease from net income of $402.8 million for fiscal 2015 . 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Fiscal Year Change 2015 2014 $ % ($ in millions) Net sales $ 9,363.8 $ 9,296.0 $ 67.8 0.7 % Cost of sales 6,445.5 6,520.1 (74.6 ) (1.1 ) Gross profit 2,918.3 2,775.9 142.4 5.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,108.9 2,001.0 107.9 5.4 Depreciation and amortization 156.6 154.4 2.2 1.4 Asset impairments 4.6 2.2 2.4 109.1 Operating earnings 648.2 618.3 29.9 4.8 Interest expense, net 23.0 10.0 13.0 130.0 Earnings before income tax expense 625.2 608.3 16.9 2.8 Income tax expense 222.4 215.2 7.2 3.3 Net income $ 402.8 $ 393.1 $ 9.7 2.5 % Net Sales Change Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 $ % ($ in millions) New video game hardware (1) $ 1,944.7 $ 2,028.7 $ (84.0 ) (4.1 )% New video game software 2,905.1 3,089.0 (183.9 ) (6.0 ) Pre-owned and value video game products 2,374.7 2,389.3 (14.6 ) (0.6 ) Video game accessories 703.0 653.6 49.4 7.6 Digital 188.3 216.3 (28.0 ) (12.9 ) Technology Brands (2) 534.0 328.6 205.4 62.5 Collectibles 309.7 75.8 233.9 308.6 Other (3) 404.3 514.7 (110.4 ) (21.4 ) Total $ 9,363.8 $ 9,296.0 $ 67.8 0.7 % Gross Profit Change Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 $ % ($ in millions) New video game hardware (1) $ 175.5 $ 196.6 $ (21.1 ) (10.7 )% New video game software 689.3 716.9 (27.6 ) (3.8 ) Pre-owned and value video game products 1,114.5 1,146.3 (31.8 ) (2.8 ) Video game accessories 255.5 246.1 9.4 3.8 Digital 149.6 152.0 (2.4 ) (1.6 ) Technology Brands (2) 306.6 169.1 137.5 81.3 Collectibles 116.6 31.9 84.7 265.5 Other (3) 110.7 117.0 (6.3 ) (5.4 ) Total $ 2,918.3 $ 2,775.9 $ 142.4 5.1 % ___________________ (1) Includes sales of hardware bundles, in which physical hardware and digital or physical software are sold together as a single SKU.

The increase in net sales during fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable store sales of 4.3% compared to fiscal 2014, due to strong sales performance in fiscal 2015 associated with video game accessories, interactive game figures and collectibles. Overall sales growth also benefited from the continued growth of our Technology Brands stores and our July 2015 acquisition of the ThinkGeek business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $430.2 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in net sales was due to the following: • Collectibles sales increased $233.9 million , or 308.6% , for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores, the acquisition of ThinkGeek in July 2015 and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. • Technology Brands sales increased $205.4 million , or 62.5% , for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to the acquisition and opening of stores within the Technology Brands segment. • Video game accessories sales increased $49.4 million, or 7.6%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to sales of accessories for use with the current generation consoles. The increases described above were partially offset by the following: • New video game software sales decreased $183.9 million, or 6.0%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $157.7 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the effects of currency, new video game software sales decreased $26.2 million due to fewer new titles that were released in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and the decline in prior generation software sales. We expect the decline in prior generation software sales to continue. • Other sales decreased $110.4 million , or 21.4% , primarily driven by a decrease in mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments. • New video game hardware sales decreased $84.0 million, or 4.1%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the reduction in price on both the PS4 and Xbox One as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $99.2 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. • Digital sales decreased $28.0 million, or 12.9%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $11.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and a larger portion of sales recognized on a net basis compared to the prior year period. • Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased $14.6 million, or 0.6%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $94.6 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the effects of currency, sales increased $80.0 million due to stronger sell-through of the current generation video game products. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased $74.6 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $142.4 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 31.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to 29.9% in fiscal 2014. The gross profit increase was primarily driven by the growth in Technology Brands, which carries a higher margin percentage than most of our other product categories. The net increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories as sales in our Technology Brands and collectibles categories continued to grow and the following product margin rate variances: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on Technology Brands sales increased to 57.4% in fiscal 2015 from 51.5% in fiscal 2014 due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores which carry higher margins than the other businesses in Technology Brands. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on digital sales increased to 79.4% in fiscal 2015 from 70.3% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a larger portion of sales recognized on a net basis in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. The increases described above were partially offset by the following: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on collectibles sales decreased to 37.6% in fiscal 2015 from 42.1% in fiscal 2014, due to the acquisition of ThinkGeek in July 2015 which carries lower gross margins compared to our collectible product offerings prior to the acquisition. 31 Table of Contents • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 46.9% in fiscal 2015 from 48.0% in fiscal 2014. The gross profit percentage decrease was driven by a greater mix of sales of next generation video game products, which carry lower margins early in the console cycle compared to the prior generation products. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on video game accessories decreased to 36.3% in fiscal 2015 from 37.7% in fiscal 2014, due to the increased mix of controllers sales, which carry lower gross margins relative to the total video game accessories category. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $107.9 million, or 5.4%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Technology Brands segment, which carries higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the other segments. Technology Brands contributed $129.0 million to the increase for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Additionally, United States Video Game Brands selling, general and administrative expenses increased $76.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to the fiscal 2014, driven mainly by costs related to the acquisition of ThinkGeek. This increase was offset in part by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing selling, general and administrative expenses by $96.4 million for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year period. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are $29.9 million and $21.5 million in stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition and opening of stores in our Technology Brands segment. Interest Income and Expense Interest expense of $23.4 million for fiscal 2015 increased $12.7 million from $10.7 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the $350.0 million issuance of 2019 Senior Notes in September 2014, which is discussed more fully in Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements. Interest income of $0.4 million for fiscal 2015, resulting from the investment of excess cash balances, decreased $0.3 million from $0.7 million in fiscal 2014. Income Tax Income tax expense was $222.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 35.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to $215.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 35.4% in fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Operating Earnings and Net Income The factors described above led to operating earnings of $648.2 million for fiscal 2015, or a 4.8% increase from operating earnings of $618.3 million for fiscal 2014. Additionally, net income was $402.8 million for fiscal 2015, which represented a 2.5% increase from net income of $393.1 million for fiscal 2014. The increase in operating earnings is primarily attributable to the growth in gross margin in our Video Game Brands segments. SEGMENT PERFORMANCE We report our business in the following segments: Video Game Brands, which consists of four geographic segments in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, and Technology Brands. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance, the way in which our sales and profits are derived and how we divide management responsibility. Our sales and profits are driven through our physical stores which are highly integrated with our e-commerce, digital and mobile businesses. Due to this integration, our physical stores are the basis for our segment reporting. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products), new and pre-owned mobile devices and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments. With our presence in international markets, we have operations in several foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and the Norwegian kroner. 32 Table of Contents Operating earnings (loss) by operating segment, defined as income from operations before intercompany royalty fees, net interest expense and income taxes, and net sales by reportable segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2017 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 5,488.9 $ 382.0 $ 609.5 $ 1,313.5 $ 814.0 $ 8,607.9 Segment operating earnings $ 430.2 $ 22.4 $ 34.9 $ 26.0 $ 44.2 $ 557.7 Segment Operating data: Store count 3,944 322 464 1,283 1,522 7,535 Comparable store sales (1) (13.5 )% (12.6 )% (2.0 )% (2.7 )% n/a (11.0 )% As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2016 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 6,435.1 $ 446.6 $ 591.4 $ 1,356.7 $ 534.0 $ 9,363.8 Segment operating earnings $ 504.3 $ 29.4 $ 38.7 $ 48.8 $ 27.0 $ 648.2 Segment Operating data: Store count 4,013 325 444 1,299 1,036 7,117 Comparable store sales (1) 4.8 % 9.8 % 7.5 % (0.8 )% n/a 4.3 % As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 6,193.5 $ 476.4 $ 644.7 $ 1,652.8 $ 328.6 $ 9,296.0 Segment operating earnings $ 483.2 $ 28.3 $ 38.0 $ 35.9 $ 32.9 $ 618.3 Segment Operating data: Store count 4,138 331 421 1,316 484 6,690 Comparable store sales (1) 2.5 % 9.3 % 10.6 % 2.3 % n/a 3.4 % ___________________ (1) Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales as we do not consider it to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Video Game Brands United States Segment results for Video Game Brands in the United States include retail GameStop operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.thinkgeek.com, Game Informer magazine and Kongregate, our leading platform for web and mobile gaming. Net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $946.2 million , or 14.7% , compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the 13.5% decrease in comparable store sales. This decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of decreases in video game hardware and software sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and the PlayStation VR. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $74.1 million compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales, partially offset by improved gross margin due to a shift in the mix of sales to higher margin categories and lower SG&A expenses. The decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily due to decreases to incentive compensation, store-related expenses and acquisition-related costs related to ThinkGeek incurred in the prior year. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce in Canada. Net sales in the Canadian segment for fiscal 2016 decreased $64.6 million , or 14.5% , compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales of 12.6% , driven by declines in video game hardware and software sales. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $7.0 million , or 23.8% primarily due to the decrease in net sales. This decrease was partially offset by the growth in collectibles sales in fiscal 2016. 33 Table of Contents Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales in the Australian segment for fiscal 2016 increased $18.1 million , or 3.1% , compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to growth in sales of collectibles, driven by the opening of 21 new Zing branded collectible stores since the prior year, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $7.7 million .  These increases were partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of 2.0% , primarily driven by decreases in video game software sales. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with expanding our collectible store base. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 10 European countries and e-commerce operations in four countries. Net sales in the European segment for fiscal 2016 decreased $43.2 million , or 3.2% , compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the 2.7% decrease in comparable store sales and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $7.2 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases in video game hardware and software sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and the PlayStation VR. Operating earnings for the fiscal 2016 decreased by $22.8 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the decline in net sales, coupled with a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name. Technology Brands Segment results for the Technology Brands segment include our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and our Simply Mac business. Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $280.0 million , or 52.4% , compared to fiscal 2015, as a result of the continued acquisition activity and growth in store count. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 increased $17.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in store count, operational improvements as stores opened in fiscal 2015 mature and greater profitability from stores acquired since the prior year. Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 include $43.4 million in store closure and impairment costs as we right-size our store portfolio following four years of acquisition activity. The costs include $19.8 million in store closure costs, $16.6 million in impairment charges of store-level property and equipment, and a $7.0 million impairment charge on our Simply Mac dealer agreements intangible asset.

Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased $241.6 million, or 3.9%, compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in comparable store sales of 4.8%. This increase in comparable store sales was driven by the increase in sales of collectibles, video game accessories, pre-owned and value video game products and next generation hardware sales in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Operating earnings for fiscal 2015 increased $21.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to fiscal 2014, driven primarily by the current year increase in net sales relative to the selling, general and administrative expenses. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce operations in Canada. Net sales in the Canadian segment for fiscal 2015 decreased $29.8 million, or 6.3%, compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $74.6 million in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 increased 9.8%, driven by strong sales of next generation hardware and software as well as collectibles. Operating earnings for fiscal 2015 increased $1.1 million, or 3.9%, compared to fiscal 2014, due to the increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations which had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $5.3 million. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales in the Australian segment for fiscal 2015 decreased $53.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $117.3 million for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 increased 7.5%, driven by strong sales of next generation hardware, pre-owned products, video game accessories and collectibles. Operating earnings for fiscal 2015 increased $0.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operating earnings increased $7.3 million primarily due to the comparable store sales increase. 34 Table of Contents Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 10 European countries and e-commerce operations in five countries. Net sales in the European segment for fiscal 2015 decreased $296.1 million, or 17.9%, compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which had the effect of decreasing net sales by $238.3 million for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, and a decrease in comparable store sales of 0.8%. Additionally, the exit of our Spain operations contributed to a $34.8 million decrease in net sales year-over-year. Operating earnings for fiscal 2015 increased $12.9 million, or 35.9%, compared to fiscal 2014, driven primarily by the pre-tax loss of $14.8 million in fiscal 2014 related to the exit of our Spain operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations also had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $3.9 million in fiscal 2015. Technology Brands Segment results for the Technology Brands segment include our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores and our Simply Mac business. Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased $205.4 million, or 62.5%, compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to our continued acquisition activity and growth in our Technology Brands store count. Operating earnings for fiscal 2015 decreased $5.9 million, or 17.9%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to store openings and conversions taking longer than anticipated to open as well as our expansion and related investments in selling, general and administrative expenses to prepare for the growth of additional stores. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our $400.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) together will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, store openings and remodeling activities and corporate capital allocation programs, including acquisitions, share repurchases and the payment of dividends declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months. As of January 28, 2017 , we had total cash on hand of $669.4 million and an additional $354.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolver. As we continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, while also enhancing shareholder value through share repurchases and dividend payments, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. As of January 28, 2017 , we had total cash on hand of $669.4 million of which $366.2 million was attributable to our foreign operations. Although we may, from time to time, evaluate strategies and alternatives with respect to the cash attributable to our foreign operations, we currently anticipate that this cash will remain in those foreign jurisdictions and it therefore may not be available for immediate use; however, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, as described more fully above, will enable us to meet our cash requirements in the next twelve months. In March 2016, we issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.75% per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on September 15, 2016. The 2021 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. Cash Flows During fiscal 2016 , cash provided by operations was $537.1 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $656.8 million in fiscal 2015 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $119.7 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in net income combined with a decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $99.6 million , due primarily to the timing of payments for income taxes and accounts payable. During fiscal 2015, cash provided by operations was $656.8 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $480.5 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in cash provided by operations of $176.3 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $167.7 million , due primarily to the timing of payments for income taxes as well as accounts payable and accrued liabilities when compared to fiscal 2014. Cash used in investing activities was $578.0 million in fiscal 2016 , $444.6 million in fiscal 2015 and $235.9 million in fiscal 2014 . In fiscal 2016, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $441.2 million , of which the significant majority was in our Technology Brands segment.  In fiscal 2015, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $267.5 million , of which $126.0 million was used to acquire ThinkGeek and $141.5 million was used in our Technology Brands segment. Capital expenditures totaled $142.7 million , $173.2 million and $159.6 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. 35 Table of Contents In fiscal 2016, our financing activities provided a net cash inflow of $238.7 million consisting primarily of $466.9 million in proceeds, net of financing costs, from the issuance of our 2021 Senior Notes, offset by dividends paid of $155.5 million and share repurchases of $63.1 million . Cash used in financing activities was $ 346.2 million in fiscal 2015 and $ 131.2 million in fiscal 2014 . The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 were primarily for the repurchase of $194.3 million of common shares and the payment of dividends on our Class A Common Stock of $154.1 million .  The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2014 were primarily for the repurchase of $331.1 million of treasury shares and the payment of dividends on our Class A Common Stock of $148.8 million , offset in part by the $350.0 million issuance of 2019 Senior Notes in September 2014. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our Revolver to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various growth initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. We have an existing $400.0 million asset-backed revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”), including a $50 million letter of credit sublimit, that expires on March 25, 2019. The Revolver has an expansion feature to allow for an additional $200.0 million if certain conditions are met. Availability under the Revolver is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. The per annum interest is variable and is based on the London Interbank Offered (“LIBO”) rate or the prime rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. As of January 28, 2017 , our applicable margins were 0.25% for prime rate loans and 1.25% for LIBO rate loans. Total availability under the Revolver was $354.0 million as of January 28, 2017 , with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $8.4 million . In March 2016, we issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.50% senior notes due October 1, 2019 (the "2019 Senior Notes," and together with the 2021 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. The agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the indentures governing our Revolver and Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our indentures governing the Senior Notes and our Revolver. See Note 9, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Revolver and Senior Notes. In September 2007, our Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary $20 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the “Line of Credit”) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of January 28, 2017 , there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $10.7 million . Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures Our future capital requirements will depend upon the timing and extent of our ongoing investments in our Technology Brands businesses, our other strategic initiatives, and the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened or acquired 583 Technology Brands stores and opened 73 Video Game Brands stores in fiscal 2016. We expect to open approximately 35 stand-alone collectibles stores and approximately 65 stores in our Technology Brands segment in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2016, in connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands segment, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of 507 AT&T authorized retailer stores for an aggregate of $440.3 million in cash (net of cash acquired), which includes working capital adjustments, and future contingent consideration which we estimate will range from $40.0 million to $50.0 million. The majority of the store acquisitions were funded by our 2021 Senior Notes. The contingent consideration will be paid in two installments. The first installment of $20 million is contingent on the relocation of certain stores and is due the latter of August 2017 or when relocations are completed. The second installment, which we expect to range from $20.0 million to $30.0 million, is contingent on sales performance of certain stores and is due in March 2018. See Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 36 Table of Contents Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are projected to be approximately $110 million to $120 million, to be used primarily to fund continued growth of our Collectibles and Technology Brands businesses, distribution and information systems and other digital initiatives in support of our operations and new store openings and store remodels. Share Repurchase Program We have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through open market transactions made from time to time. Shares repurchased are subsequently retired. In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing our management to repurchase up to $500 million of our Class A Common Stock with no expiration date, of which $170.2 million remained available under the program as of January 28, 2017. We generally seek Board of Directors’ approval for a new authorization before the existing program is fully utilized to ensure we maintain availability under a repurchase program. Share repurchase activity for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in millions, except for per share data): Fiscal Year 2016 2015 2014 Total number of shares purchased 3.0 5.2 8.4 Average price per share $ 24.94 $ 38.68 $ 39.50 Aggregate value of shares purchased $ 75.1 $ 202.0 $ 333.4 Dividends We paid cash dividends of $155.5 million , $154.1 million and $148.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. On February 28, 2017 , our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.52 per share of Class A Common Stock, with the first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2017 payable on March 28, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 14, 2017 . Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Our payment of dividends is and will continue to be restricted by or subject to, among other limitations, applicable provisions of federal and state laws, our earnings and various business considerations, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, our future business prospects, our status as a holding company and such other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the senior credit facility and of the indentures governing our Senior Notes restrict our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances as stated above. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our Senior Notes. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of January 28, 2017 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating leases $ 1,194.6 $ 388.6 $ 498.2 $ 190.1 $ 117.7 Purchase obligations (1) 746.0 743.8 2.0 0.2 — 2019 Senior Notes 350.0 — 350.0 — — 2021 Senior Notes 475.0 — — 475.0 — Interest payments on senior notes 202.0 51.3 102.6 48.1 — Contingent consideration (2) 43.2 20.0 23.2 — — Total (3) $ 3,010.8 $ 1,203.7 $ 976.0 $ 713.4 $ 117.7 ___________________ (1) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (2) Contingent consideration relates to our acquisition of stores from an AT&T authorized retailer in fiscal 2016. The amount in the table reflects the fair value of our best estimate of the contingent payments, which will be paid in two installments. The first installment of $20.0 million is contingent on the relocation of certain stores and is due the latter of August 2017 or when relocations are completed. The second installment, which we expect to range from $20.0 million to $30.0 million, is contingent on sales performance of certain stores and is due in March 2018. (3) As of January 28, 2017 , we had $42.5 million of income tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability (and the timing of any related payments) cannot be reasonably determined and therefore these liabilities are excluded from the table above. In addition, certain payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. See Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our uncertain tax positions. We lease retail stores, warehouse facilities, office space and equipment. These are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates through 2033 with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have been classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require us to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. 37 Table of Contents As of January 28, 2017 , we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.4 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $24.5 million , $8.3 million of which are cash collateralized. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 28, 2017 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements, with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories Estimate Description. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value.  A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at January 28, 2017 would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.6 million in fiscal 2016. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors Estimate Description. We participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which our vendors provide us with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors’ products. The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs generally cover a period from a few weeks up to a month and include items such as product in-store display promotions and placement, internet advertising, co-op print advertising and other programs. The allowance for each event is negotiated with the vendor and requires specific performance by us to be earned. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a significant portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory rather than as an offset to our marketing and advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. We estimate the amount of vendor allowances to be deferred as a reduction of inventory based on the nature of the consideration received and the merchandise inventory to which the consideration relates. We apply a sell-through rate to determine the timing in which the consideration should be recognized in cost of sales. Consideration received that relates to video game products that have not yet been released to the public is deferred. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Although we consider our advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances.  Additionally, if actual results are not consistent with our estimated deferrals and sell-through rates, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially impact our gross profit rates and inventory balances. A 10% difference in our vendor allowances deferral at January 28, 2017 would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.0 million in fiscal 2016. Customer Liabilities Estimate Description. Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts or merchandise. We estimate the net cost of the rewards that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost and the associated liability as points are earned by our loyalty program members. Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected 38 Table of Contents third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card.  We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer or the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote, which is a concept known in the retail industry as breakage. We determine our gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average cost per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. A weighted-average cost per point redeemed is used to estimate future redemption costs. The weighted-average cost per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual costs incurred to fulfill points that have been redeemed by our loyalty program members and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. Potential Impact if Results Differ . We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average cost per point redeemed at January 28, 2017, in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.6 million in fiscal 2016. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at January 28, 2017 would have affected net earnings by approximately $6.4 million in fiscal 2016. Goodwill Estimate Description. Goodwill results from acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. We are required to evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment are present. Our annual test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter, and interim tests are conducted when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As of January 28, 2017, our goodwill totaled $ 1,725.2 million . See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for the allocation of our goodwill balance by reporting unit. We use a two-step process to test our goodwill for impairment. Step 1 consists of comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of our reporting units is determined based on its projected discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test is needed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to the acquisition method of accounting used in a business combination. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The discounted cash flows analyses utilizes a five-year cash flow projection with a terminal value which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit. The projected cash flows include numerous assumptions such as, among others, projected sales trends, earnings margins, store count and capital expenditures, all of which are consistent with our internal operating plans. In addition, we corroborate the aggregate fair value of our reporting units with our market capitalization which may impact certain assumptions in our discounted cash flows analyses. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Variations in any of the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses may arrive at different estimated fair values that could result in a material impairment charge. Based on the results of our annual impairment test in fiscal 2016, the fair values of our United States, Canada and Technology Brands reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 40%. The fair values of our Australia and Europe reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 24% and 22%, respectively. A reduction in the terminal growth rate assumption of 0.5% or an increase in the discount rate assumption of 1.0% utilized in the test for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in impairment. Sustained declines in our stock price and related market capitalization could impact key assumptions and the estimated fair values of our reporting units that could result in material goodwill impairment charges. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results, our assumptions or in our stock price. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Estimate Description. Indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded as a result of acquisitions and primarily consist of AT&T dealer agreements, Simply Mac dealer agreements, the Micromania trade name and the ThinkGeek trade name. As these intangible assets are expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely, they are not subject to amortization. We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year. 39 Table of Contents We value our dealer agreements using a discounted cash flow analysis known as the Greenfield Method, which assumes that a business, at its inception, owns only dealer agreements and must make capital expenditure, working capital and other investments to ramp up its operations to a level that is comparable to its current operations. We value our trade names using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. As of January 28, 2017, our indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $453.0 million . Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing our dealer agreement assets, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the cash flows required to build a comparable operation and the available future cash flows from these operations. Specifically, we are required to make certain assumptions about the cost of investment to build a comparable operation, projected net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes, as well as the discount rate that is applied to the expected future cash flows to arrive at an estimated fair value. In valuing our trade names, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding future cash flow projections to ensure that such projections represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the royalty rate is applied. Additionally, management judgment is necessary in selecting an appropriate discount rate which is reflective of the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. Potential Impact if Results Differ . As a result of our annual impairment testing, we recognized impairment charges totaling $14.4 million associated with our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Simply Mac dealer agreements were impaired by $7.0 million to their estimated fair value of $11.0 million and the Micromania trade name was impaired by $7.4 million to its estimated fair value of $35.0 million . Recent revenue and profitability measures associated with Simply Mac and Micromania indicated that future revenue and profitability no longer supported the carrying value of these intangible assets. The estimated fair values of our AT&T dealer agreements and ThinkGeek trade name exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. Changes in the projected cash flows and the assumptions utilized in estimating the present value of the cash flows attributable to dealer agreements and trade names could materially impact the fair value estimates, which would increase or decrease the impairment charges. Regarding our Simply Mac dealer agreements, a 10% decline in projected sales would result in an increase of approximately $1.9 million in the impairment charge. Regarding our Micromania trade name, a 10% decline in sales in each forecast period, including the terminal period, would result in an increase of approximately $2.0 million in the impairment charge. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results or our assumptions. Income Taxes Estimate Description. We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $42.5 million as of January 28, 2017. Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Our valuation allowance was $39.4 million as of January 28, 2017. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Additionally, several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. 40 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting standards and pronouncements.    

  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps (together, the “foreign currency contracts”) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 , we recognized a $20.0 million gain in selling, general and administrative expenses related to derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of the foreign currency contracts as of January 28, 2017 was a net asset of $ 9.0 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of January 28, 2017 would result in a gain or loss in value of the forwards, options and swaps of $9.4 million . We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. Interest Rate Risk Our Revolver’s per annum interest rate is variable and is based on one of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) the LIBO rate or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. Our Senior Notes' per annum interest rate is fixed. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and we therefore believe that we do not have significant interest rate exposure.

   Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Video Game Brands The Video Game Brands segments include 5,899 stores, 3,864 of which are included in the United States segment. There are 321 , 467 , and 1,247 stores in the Canadian, Australian and European segments, respectively. The stores in our four Video Game Brands segments operate primarily under the names GameStop TM (“GameStop”), EB Games TM (“EB Games”), and Micromania. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories, which we refer to as video game products. Our Video Game Brands stores sell various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software and also sell collectible products and certain mobile and consumer electronics products. Through our omnichannel sales process, including iOS and Android mobile applications, our customers can buy video game products and other merchandise online, reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. We operate e-commerce sites under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek, that allow our customers to buy video game products, collectibles and other merchandise online. Our family of brands also includes Game Informer TM (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication. 1 Within our Video Game Brands segments, we operate 103 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers, with 66 collectibles stores in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture brand and 37 stores in the United States operating under the ThinkGeek brand. Technology Brands Our Technology Brands segment includes our Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses. Spring Mobile operates 1,329 AT&T branded wireless retail stores. The AT&T branded stores sell both pre and post-paid AT&T services, DIRECTV service and wireless products, as well as related accessories and other consumer electronics products. Simply Mac operates 48 Simply Mac© branded stores which sell Apple products, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smart phones and related accessories and other consumer electronics products. As an authorized Apple reseller, Simply Mac also offers certified training, warranty and repair services to its customers. Market Size Video Game Products. Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD") and International Development Group ("IDG"), we estimate that the market for new physical video game products was approximately $18 billion in 2017 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $15 billion and $26 billion in 2017 . Mobile and Consumer Electronics. The mobile and consumer electronics market, as we refer to it, consists primarily of wireless services, new and pre-owned mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, consumer electronics such as Apple products and services, non-gaming headsets and accessories. The market for wireless devices and services is estimated by CTIA — The Wireless Association ® to exceed $188 billion. Merchandise We categorize our sale of products and services as follows: • New Video Game Hardware. We offer video game platforms from the major manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (March 2017). In 2016, Sony and Microsoft released refreshes to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively. In November 2017, Microsoft released a further enhanced version of its current generation console, the Xbox One X. We also offer extended service agreements on video game hardware and software. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. • New Video Game Software. We offer new video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. We are one of the largest retailers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We carry new video game software across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. • Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection of pre-owned video game titles which have an average price of $25 as compared to an average price of $48 for new video game titles and which generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. • Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. • Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as full-game downloads and digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency and we have developed technology to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency and DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. 2 • Technology Brands. Technology Brands consist primarily of wireless products, services and accessories and consumer electronics offered in our Technology Brands segment through Spring Mobile managed AT&T branded stores and Simply Mac stores. • Collectibles .  Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop culture themes which are sold through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com. • Other Products. Other products primarily consist of PC entertainment software, gaming-related print media, mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments, and revenues from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision Blizzard across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and interactive game figures, such as Amiibos from Nintendo and Skylanders from Activision Blizzard. Store Operations We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,700 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us. Our Technology Brands stores vary in size, with an average size of approximately 1,900 square feet. Our Spring Mobile managed AT&T branded stores carry wireless products and accessories, and our Simply Mac stores carry Apple and other consumer electronics. Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Site Selection and Locations Site Selection. Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. Spring Mobile managed AT&T branded stores are selected after approval from AT&T. Simply Mac stores are selected with input from Apple. In each of our geographic segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations. 3 Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the U.S. Video Game Brands and Technology Brands segments as of February 3, 2018 : U.S. Video Game Brands Technology Brands U.S. Video Game Brands Technology Brands U.S. Video Game Brands Technology Brands Alabama 61 6 Kentucky 70 23 Ohio 169 1 Alaska 7 6 Louisiana 63 17 Oklahoma 49 28 Arizona 73 31 Maine 11 1 Oregon 35 37 Arkansas 31 26 Maryland 87 8 Pennsylvania 185 36 California 384 197 Massachusetts 82 32 Rhode Island 12 1 Colorado 58 31 Michigan 103 — South Carolina 68 27 Connecticut 47 26 Minnesota 45 36 South Dakota 11 — Delaware 14 13 Mississippi 44 26 Tennessee 93 30 District of Columbia — 2 Missouri 68 45 Texas 367 118 Florida 246 74 Montana 10 9 Utah 27 38 Georgia 129 59 Nebraska 21 4 Vermont 4 — Guam 2 — Nevada 38 13 Virginia 122 30 Hawaii 18 — New Hampshire 26 7 Washington 74 49 Idaho 16 8 New Jersey 115 22 West Virginia 29 1 Illinois 147 82 New Mexico 25 8 Wisconsin 58 31 Indiana 92 40 New York 219 38 Wyoming 7 9 Iowa 31 9 North Carolina 132 26 Kansas 31 16 North Dakota 8 — Total Domestic Stores 3,864 1,377 International Locations.

Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had over 37 million members as of February 3, 2018 including 16 million whom have purchased at GameStop in the past year. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 19 million members as of February 3, 2018 . Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products. Approximately 6.3 million of the 37.0 million U.S. loyalty members were paying members. Game Informer We publish Game Informer , the world’s largest print and digital video game publication and website featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fourth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2017 issue, the magazine had approximately 7.5 million paid subscribers, including more than 2.1 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Vendors We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from approximately 100 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors in our Video Game Brands segments accounted for approximately 76% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2017 . Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts accounted for 22% , 20% , 10% , 6% , and 6% , respectively, of our new product purchases in our Video Game Brands segments during fiscal 2017 . We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase substantially all of our products in our Technology Brands segment through our agreements with AT&T and Apple. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our distribution facilities and inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Competition The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores compete with mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, among others, as well as other pre-paid and post-paid wireless carriers and their distribution channels, including Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our Simply Mac stores compete with mass-market retailers as noted above. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2017 and 2016 , we generated approximately 38% and 35% , respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. 5 Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Zing Pop Culture,” “Spring Mobile,” “Simply Mac,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 22,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 25,000 and 45,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit. Sustainability We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2017 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over six million pieces of software (CDs) and over three million consumer electronic devices, and recycled almost 2.2 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure, and look for cost-effective ways to reduce, our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past six years.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report, before you make an investment decision with respect to our company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Economic conditions in the U.S. and in certain international markets could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing video game products, when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of the Company's control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and civil disturbances. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 6 The video game industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business. The video game industry has historically been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. In addition, the features of new consoles or changes to the existing generations of consoles, including any future restrictions or conditions or the ability to play prior generation video games on such consoles, may adversely affect our pre-owned business. The current generation console cycle began when Sony and Microsoft launched the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. Nintendo introduced the Switch in March 2017. If the current video game platforms do not continue to be successful, our sales of video game products could decline. The introduction of next-generation consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business, which could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. We depend upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors. We depend on manufacturers and publishers to deliver video game hardware, software, and wireless and consumer electronics in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. In addition, we depend on these manufacturers and publishers to introduce new and innovative products and software titles to drive industry sales. We have experienced sales declines in the past due to a reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms, software titles or wireless devices could result in reduced sales. If we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. The interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. The popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming has increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to respond to this growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming and transition our business to take advantage of these new forms of gaming. In order to continue to compete effectively in the video game industry, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers’ preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to keep pace with these changes. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower our sales. The current consoles from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. Downloading of video game content to the current generation video game systems continues to grow and take an increasing percentage of new video game sales. If consumers' preference for downloading video game content continues to increase or these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers’ ability to access and download the current format of video games and incremental content for their games through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase video games in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of game delivery. As a result, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our sales of collectibles depend on popularity of and trends in pop culture, and our ability to react to them. Our sales of collectibles are heavily dependent upon the continued demand by our customers for collectibles, apparel, toys, gadgets, electronics and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts. The popularity of such products is often driven by movies, television shows, music, fashion and other pop culture influences. The market for, and appeal of, particular types of music, movies, television shows, artists, actors, styles, trends and brands is constantly changing. Our failure to anticipate, identify and react appropriately to changing trends and preferences of customers could lead to, among other things, excess inventories and higher markdowns. There can be no assurance that the collectibles and related products that we sell will appeal to our customers. 7 We depend on licensed products for a substantial portion of our sales of collectibles and our inability to maintain such licenses and obtain new licensed products would adversely affect our sales of collectibles. We license from others the rights to sell certain of our collectibles and many of these products contain a third party’s trademarks, designs and other intellectual property. If we are unable to maintain current licenses or obtain new licensed products with comparable consumer demand, our sales of collectibles would decline. Furthermore, we may not be able to prevent a licensor from choosing not to renew a license with us and/or from licensing a product to one of our competitors. Our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers may impact our financial results. Our financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors. Our largest vendors in our Video Game Brands segments are Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, which accounted for 22% , 20% , 10% , 6% and 6% , respectively, of our new product purchases in fiscal 2017 . If our suppliers do not provide us with favorable business terms, we may not be able to offer products to our customers at competitive prices. If our vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted. The manufacturers of video game hardware and software have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. Additionally, AT&T and Apple provide our Technology Brands stores with similar support.  As part of this support, we receive cooperative advertising and market development payments from these vendors which enable us to actively promote and merchandise the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. We cannot assure you that vendors will continue to provide this support at historical levels. If they fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. The profitability of our Technology Brands segment is dependent in large part on our relationship with AT&T and any material adverse change to this relationship would affect our results. Our Technology Brands segment is primarily conducted through Spring Mobile, an AT&T authorized retailer currently operating 1,329 AT&T branded stores selling pre-paid and post-paid wireless services and products. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with AT&T for the profitability of our Technology Brands segment. We depend on AT&T for constant innovation and the timely delivery of products and services to our stores. Material adverse changes in our relationship with AT&T, including termination of the relationship (which is permissible upon a short notice period), the lack of innovation or failure to timely supply products or competitive service plans, or changes in the manner in which AT&T compensates its authorized retailers, could materially adversely impact the profitability of our Technology Brands segment and our financial condition and results of operations. See Part II,    

 Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Segment Performance — Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 — Technology Brands” for additional information. Our relationship with AT&T restricts our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses. We are a significant retailer of AT&T products and services through our Technology Brands segment. Our agreements with AT&T and its affiliates impose significant restrictions on our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses, including several that are adjacent to markets in which we participate or are considering entering, which could materially adversely impact this component of our business. We have made and may make investments and acquisitions which could negatively impact our business if we fail to successfully complete and integrate them, or if they fail to perform in accordance with our expectations. To enhance our efforts to grow and compete, we have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions. Our plans to pursue future transactions are subject to our ability to identify potential candidates and negotiate favorable terms for these transactions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that future investments or acquisitions will be completed. In addition, to facilitate future transactions, we may take actions that could dilute the equity interests of our stockholders, increase our debt or cause us to assume contingent liabilities, all of which may have a detrimental effect on the price of our common stock. Also, companies that we have acquired, and that we may acquire in the future, could have products that are in development, and there is no assurance that these products will be successfully developed. Finally, if any acquisitions are not successfully integrated with our business, or fail to perform in accordance with our expectations, our ongoing operations could be adversely affected. 8 Pressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which could decrease our profitability. The retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Wal-Mart and Target; computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy; internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com; other U.S. and international video game and PC software specialty stores located in malls and other locations, such as Carrefour and Media Markt; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and may have greater financial resources than we do or other advantages. In addition, video game products and content are increasingly being digitally distributed and new competitors built to take advantage of these new capabilities are entering the marketplace, and other methods may emerge in the future. We also compete with other sellers of pre-owned video game products and other PC software distribution companies, including Steam. Certain of our mass-merchant competitors are expanding in the market for pre-owned video games through aggressive pricing which may negatively affect our margins, sales and earnings for these products.  Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including browser, social and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. Our Technology Brands stores compete with a wide variety of other wireless carriers and retailers and consumer electronics retailers, including AT&T stores that are not operated by us. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, we may be less profitable. Our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or our failure to retain key employees in the future may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We recently experienced a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) transition, as well as other senior management changes. On February 4, 2018, Michael Mauler was appointed CEO. His appointment follows the appointment of Daniel A. DeMatteo as our interim CEO on November 13, 2017 as the result of a medical event experienced by our former CEO, J. Paul Raines. In addition to the CEO change, certain other members of our executive team have recently departed. Any failures in the transition of our executive team could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers. Our continued success depends upon customers' perception of our Company. Any negative publicity relating to our vendors, products, practices or our Company could damage our reputation. The increased use of social media platforms allows for the rapid disbursement of information, including negative feedback or other commentary, which could negatively impact our reputation and result in declines in customer loyalty and adversely affect our results of operations. International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. Our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our international operations expose us to numerous risks. We have international retail operations in Australia, Canada and Europe. Because release schedules for hardware and software introduction in these markets can sometimes differ from release schedules in the United States, the timing of increases and decreases in foreign sales may differ from the timing of increases and decreases in domestic sales. We are also subject to a number of other factors that may affect our current or future international operations. These include: • economic downturns, specifically in the regions in which we operate; • currency exchange rate fluctuations; • international incidents; • natural disasters; • government instability; and • competitors entering our current and potential markets. 9 Our operations in Europe are also subject to risks associated with the current economic conditions and uncertainties in the European Union (“EU”). In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the exit of that country from the EU (“Brexit”), and the British government has officially notified the EU that it intends withdrawal the U.K. from the EU. The Brexit vote and related withdrawal negotiations have created significant economic uncertainty in Europe. In addition, European and global economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the inability of certain EU member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. There continues to be uncertainty over the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles, the ultimate outcome of the EU governments’ financial support programs, the possible breakup or restructuring of the EU and the possible elimination or restructuring of the EU monetary system. These continued uncertainties could further disrupt European and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products. These factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business. Changes to tariff and import/export regulations may negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. The United States and other countries have from time to time proposed and enacted protectionist trade policies that could increase the cost or reduce the availability of certain merchandise. In particular, the current U.S. administration has made certain changes to import/export tariffs and international trade agreements. The changes announced and made to date do not impact the merchandise that we offer. Any measures that could impact the cost or availability of the merchandise we offer could have an adverse impact on our business because a significant portion of the products we offer are purchased from foreign vendors and manufactured in foreign countries. Unfavorable changes in our global tax rate could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be higher than other companies or higher than our tax rates have been in the past. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our business and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. A change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any jurisdiction in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of our operations. Restrictions on our ability to take trade-ins of and sell pre-owned video game products or pre-owned mobile devices could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results depend on our ability to take trade-ins of, and sell, pre-owned video game products and pre-owned mobile devices within our stores. Actions by manufacturers or publishers of video game products or mobile devices, wireless carriers or governmental authorities to prohibit or limit our ability to take trade-ins or sell pre-owned video game products or mobile devices, or to limit the ability of consumers to play pre-owned video games or use pre-owned mobile devices, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Sales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and our financial results may be adversely affected as a result. Many popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an “M” or “T” rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 10 An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2017, we generated approximately 38% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • the timing of new store openings or closings; • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; and • changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. Failure to effectively manage our new store openings could lower our sales and profitability. Our sales and profitability depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We opened 46 Video Game Brands stores (including 20 collectibles stores) and opened or acquired 56 Technology Brands stores in fiscal 2017 . Our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include: • the ability to identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost efficient manner; • the ability to hire and train skilled associates; • the ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations; and • the ability to increase sales at new store locations. If we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease. Failure to successfully execute our strategy to close stores and transfer customers and sales to nearby stores could adversely impact our financial results. Our strategy includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring revenue to other nearby locations. We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue may be adversely affected. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion. We rely on centralized facilities for refurbishment of our pre-owned products. Any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on centralized facilities for the refurbishment of all pre-owned products that we sell. If any disruption occurred at these facilities, whether due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, systems failures, or other unforeseen causes, sales of our pre-owned products could decrease. Since we generally obtain higher margins on our pre-owned products, any adverse effect on their sales could adversely affect our profitability. 11 If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our distribution centers, as well as to communicate distribution information to the off-site, third-party operated distribution centers with which we work. The third-party distribution centers pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles and deliver them to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores at least twice a week, to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform their functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted or if these centers were unable to accommodate stores in a particular region, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we do not maintain the security of our member, customer, employee or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. An important part of our business involves the receipt, processing and storage of personal information of our customers, members and employees, including, in the case of customers, payment information. We have systems and processes in place that are designed to protect against security and data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information.  Nevertheless, cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Techniques or software used to gain unauthorized access, and/or disable, degrade or harm our systems may be difficult to detect for prolonged periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or put in place protective or preventive measures. These attempts to gain unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. If individuals are successful in infiltrating, breaking into, disrupting, damaging or otherwise stealing from the computer systems of the Company or its third-party providers, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, including interruptions in our ability to accept payment from customers and our ability to issue and redeem loyalty points under our Power Up Rewards program. Such an event may also expose us to costly litigation, government investigations, government enforcement actions, fines and/or lawsuits and may significantly harm our reputation with our members and customers. We are continuously working to install new, and upgrade our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to protect our member, customer, employee, and company data against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against future data security breaches. While past cybersecurity attacks have not resulted in material losses, a data security breach or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could materially impact our business and our results of operations.  Moreover, a data security breach or change in applicable privacy or security laws or regulations could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the breach or such change in laws or regulations and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard against such breaches or to comply with such change in laws or regulations, which could disrupt our business, operations and financial condition. Litigation and the outcomes of such litigation could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various litigation and legal proceedings, including matters involving wage and hour employee class actions, stockholder and consumer class actions, tax audits and unclaimed property audits by states. The outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and the magnitude of potential losses therefrom, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Certain of these legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may require changes to our business operations that negatively impact our operating results or involve significant liability awards that impact our financial condition. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. As a result, legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See   

 Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for additional information. Risks Relating to Indebtedness Because of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our senior credit facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 13 The terms of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The terms of our Senior Notes and our senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us in certain circumstances. These restrictions, among other things, limit our ability to: • incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guaranty obligations; • incur liens or agree to negative pledges in other agreements; • engage in sale and leaseback transactions; • make loans and investments; • declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock; • engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations; • prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; • amend or otherwise alter the terms of our organizational documents and indebtedness; • sell assets; and • engage in transactions with affiliates. We cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures for the Senior Notes, or under our senior credit facility, could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applied. In addition, an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made under our senior credit facility or to holders of our Senior Notes, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or if that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments, then in effect. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those sales and raise debt or equity to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance would also depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage. We are able to incur additional indebtedness. Although our senior credit facility and the indentures for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Such future indebtedness or obligations may have restrictions similar to, or more restrictive than, those included in the indentures for our Senior Notes or our senior credit facility. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could impact our financial condition and results of operations.   

 Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein for further information regarding restrictions on our dividend payments. Approximate Number of Holders of Common Equity As of March 22, 2018 , there were approximately 1,397 record holders of our Class A Common Stock. 16 Stock Comparative Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A Common Stock for the period commencing February 1, 2013 through February 2, 2018 (the last trading date of fiscal 2017) with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (the “S&P 500”) and the Dow Jones Retailers, Other Specialty Industry Group Index (the “Dow Jones Specialty Retailers Index”) over the same period. Total return values were calculated based on cumulative total return assuming (i) the investment of $100 in our Class A Common Stock, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Specialty Retailers Index on February 1, 2013 and (ii) reinvestment of dividends.

In fiscal 2013, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $10.2 million related to our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs. (2) Asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2017 are primarily associated with intangible assets in our Technology Brands segment; see Note 6, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Also included in these charges were $18.2 million of other asset impairments, primarily associated with store-level property and equipment. Asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2016 include $19.4 million of store-level property and equipment impairments, a $7.4 million impairment to our Micromania trade name and a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreements. Asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were primarily related to store-level property and equipment. Asset impairment charges in fiscal 2013 include $9.0 million related to store-level property and equipment and $9.5 million related to certain technology assets and other intangible assets as a result of our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs. (3) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for fiscal year 2017 compares the 53 weeks for the period ended February 3, 2018 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. Instead, we measure the performance of our Technology Brands stores by using comparable store gross profit, which is calculated using a similar methodology as comparable store sales, but replacing sales with gross profit in the calculation. During the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018, comparable store gross profit for our Technology Brands stores declined 13.1%. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (4) In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted Accounting Standard Update 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As a result, we have recast the fiscal 2015 and 2014 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. (5) In March 2016, we issued $475 million aggregate principal of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due in March 2021. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal of 5.50% unsecured senior notes due in October 2019. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 19   

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, management’s plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward-looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward-looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including the factors disclosed under Part I,   

Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a global family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Within our family of brands, we are the world’s largest omnichannel video game retailer, the largest AT&T® (“AT&T”) authorized retailer, the largest Apple© (“Apple”) certified products reseller, and the owner of www.thinkgeek.com, one of the world’s largest sellers of collectible pop-culture themed products. As of February 3, 2018 , GameStop's retail network and family of brands include 7,276 company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We have five reportable segments, which are comprised of four geographic Video Game Brands segments—United States, Canada, Australia and Europe—and a Technology Brands segment. Our Technology Brands segment includes our Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses. Spring Mobile owns and operates our AT&T branded wireless retail stores. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2017 consisted of the 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2018 ("fiscal 2017"). Fiscal year 2016 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2017 ("fiscal 2016") and fiscal year 2015 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2015"). Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. Gaming consoles are typically launched in cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in graphics, audio quality, game play, internet connectivity and other entertainment capabilities beyond video gaming. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (March 2017). In 2016, Sony and Microsoft released refreshes to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively, and Sony also released the PlayStation VR. In November 2017, Microsoft released a further enhanced version of its current generation console, the Xbox One X. The sale of video games delivered through digital channels and other forms of gaming continue to grow and take an increasing percentage of physical video game sales. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), full-game downloads, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We have made significant investments in e-commerce and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to access digital content easily and facilitate the digital sales and delivery process. We plan to continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category. In our discussion of the results of operations, we refer to comparable store sales, which is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for fiscal year 2017 compares the 53 weeks for the period ended February 3, 2018 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year.

Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix.

We include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales in the statement of operations. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in SG&A. The net effect of these classifications as a percentage of sales has not historically been material.

Sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $142.6 million. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable store sales of 5.8% compared to the prior year and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $104.6 million . The increase in comparable store sales was primarily the result of an increase in sales of new video game hardware, collectibles, video game accessories and new video game software. The increase in sales in collectibles are a result of the Company's diversification strategy. These increases were partially offset by an decrease in sales in pre-owned and value video game products. The increase in net sales was due to the following: • New video game hardware sales increased $395.1 million , or 28.3% , for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the launch of the Nintendo Switch in March 2017, which was partially offset by decreases in sales of other consoles as their cycles mature. • Collectibles sales increased $142.1 million , or 28.8% , for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due to the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. • Video game accessories increased $107.6 million , or 15.9% , for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recent release of the Nintendo Switch. • New video game software sales increased $88.6 million , or 3.6% , for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recent release of the Nintendo Switch. The increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in pre-owned and value video game product sales of $104.5 million , or 4.6% , for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles mainly in the first half of the current fiscal year. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased $585.9 million , or 10.5% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the change in net sales discussed above as well as the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $30.8 million , or 1.0% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 35.0% in fiscal 2016 . The increase in gross profit was driven by increases of $39.4 million in Technology Brands, primarily related to growth through acquisitions, $36.6 million in collectibles and $19.8 million in video game accessories. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $67.0 million in pre-owned and value video game products and $10.1 million in new video game software. The net decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories and the following product margin rate variances: • New video game hardware decreased to 9.1% in fiscal 2017 from 11.0% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix shift in console sales. • New video game software decreased to 22.9% in fiscal 2017 from 24.1% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower cooperative advertising funds as a percentage of sales combined with higher promotional activity in the fiscal 2017 holiday season. • Pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 45.5% in fiscal 2017 from 46.3% in fiscal 2016 due to a greater mix of sales of current generation products, which carry lower gross margin than previous generation products. • Video game accessories decreased to 32.5% in fiscal 2017 from 34.8% in fiscal 2016, due to a shift in product mix including PlayStation VR which carry lower margin. • Collectibles decreased to 32.7% in fiscal 2017 from 34.7% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased promotional activity in the fiscal 2017 holiday season. The decreases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in Technology Brands gross margin to 73.9% in fiscal 2017 from 68.1% in fiscal 2016, due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores, which carry higher margins than the other businesses inside Technology Brands. 24 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased $110.4 million , or 4.9% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Technology Brands segment stores in the second half of fiscal 2016, which have higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales compared to the Video Game Brands segments, the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $14.5 million , or 8.8% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily due to certain corporate assets being fully depreciated and certain intangible assets being fully amortized. Goodwill and Asset Impairments During fiscal 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $32.8 million and asset impairment charges totaling $358.0 million . These impairment charges were primarily associated with intangible assets in our Technology Brands segment; see Note 6, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Also included in these charges were $18.2 million of other asset impairments, primarily associated with store-level property and equipment. In fiscal 2016, we recognized asset impairment charges consisting of $19.4 million in impairments to store-level property and equipment, a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name intangible asset, and a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset. The Micromania trade name is associated with our operations in France. The property and equipment impairments were primarily related to our Technology Brands segment. Income Tax Income tax expense was $45.6 million , representing an effective tax rate of 56.8% in fiscal 2017 , compared to $151.5 million , representing an effective tax rate of 30.0% in fiscal 2016 . The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by tax reform, the impairment of goodwill, changes in uncertain tax positions and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Operating Earnings and Net Income The factors described above led to operating earnings of $135.6 million for fiscal 2017 , or a 75.7% decrease from operating earnings of $557.7 million for fiscal 2016 . Additionally, net income was $34.7 million for fiscal 2017 , which represented a 90.2% decrease from net income of $353.2 million for fiscal 2016 . The impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 was an increase to operating earnings of approximately $14.5 million.

The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales of 11.0% compared to the prior year. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of video game hardware and software. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales in Technology Brands and collectibles as a result of the Company's diversification efforts. The decrease in net sales was due to the following: • New video game hardware sales decreased $548.0 million, or 28.2%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decline in the quantity of hardware units sold combined with a reduction in selling price of certain models as the console cycle matures. • New video game software sales decreased $411.7 million, or 14.2%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to weaker new title releases in the current year. • Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased $120.6 million, or 5.1%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles and hardware unit sales declines in the current year. • Other sales decreased $106.4 million, or 26.3%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the decline in sales of interactive game figures and mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands stores. The decreases described above were partially offset by the following: • Technology Brands sales increased $280.0 million, or 52.4%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the acquisition and opening of Spring Mobile managed AT&T stores within the Technology Brands segment. • Collectibles sales increased $184.4 million, or 59.5%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, due to the acquisition of ThinkGeek in July 2015, the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased $846.9 million, or 13.1%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $91.0 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to 31.2% in fiscal 2015. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by our diversification efforts through the growth of Technology Brands and collectibles. Gross profit from Technology Brands increased $248.0 million, mainly due to growth through acquisitions and new store openings, and gross profit from collectibles increased by $55.0 million. In addition, gross profit from digital increased by $5.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases primarily in new video game software of $88.9 million, pre-owned and value video game products of $70.4 million, new video game hardware of $21.3 million, video game accessories of $20.3 million and other of $17.0 million. The net increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories as our Technology Brands and collectibles categories continue to grow and the following product margin rate variances: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on Technology Brands sales increased to 68.1% in fiscal 2016 from 57.4% in fiscal 2015 due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores which carry higher margins than the other businesses inside Technology Brands. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on digital sales increased to 85.9% in fiscal 2016 from 79.4% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of sales and the related commissions on the digital products we sold. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales of other products increased to 31.5% in fiscal 2016 from 27.4% in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by higher gross margin in mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands stores. The increases described above were partially offset by the following: • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on collectibles decreased to 34.7% in fiscal 2016 from 37.6% in fiscal 2015, due to the addition of the ThinkGeek.com business in July 2015 which carries higher fulfillment costs compared to our in-store sales. • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on video game accessories decreased to 34.8% in fiscal 2016 from 36.3% in fiscal 2015, due to the introduction of the PlayStation VR in fiscal 2016, which carries a lower gross margin than other accessory products. 27 • Gross profit as a percentage of sales on pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 46.3% in fiscal 2016 from 46.9% in fiscal 2015 due to a greater mix of sales of current generation products, which carry lower gross margin than previous generation products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $143.7 million, or 6.8%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The growth of Technology Brands contributed $195.2 million to the increase of SG&A, primarily driven by the addition of 486 stores when compared to the prior year and a higher SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to our Video Game Brands segments. The increase in SG&A related to Technology Brands includes store closure costs totaling $19.8 million in fiscal 2016, primarily associated with consolidating the Technology Brands segment store portfolio following increased acquisition activity. These increases were partially offset by a $31.9 million decrease to incentive compensation in our Video Game Brands segments, various cost reduction efforts and $7.4 million in acquisition-related costs associated with ThinkGeek incurred in the prior year. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.6 million, or 5.5%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition and opening of stores in our Technology Brands segment. Asset Impairments During fiscal 2016, we recognized asset impairment charges totaling $33.8 million. These charges consisted of $19.4 million in impairments to store-level property and equipment, a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name intangible asset, and a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset. The Micromania trade name is associated with our operations in France. The property and equipment impairments were primarily related to our Technology Brands segment. In fiscal 2015, we recognized asset impairment charges totaling $4.6 million, primarily related to store-level property and equipment impairments in our Video Game Brands segments. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense net of $53.0 million for fiscal 2016 increased $30.0 million from $23.0 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the $475.0 million issuance of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 in March 2016, which is further discussed in Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements. Income Tax Income tax expense was $151.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 30.0% in fiscal 2016, compared to $222.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the recognition of tax benefits related to our adoption of a plan of reorganization specific to certain foreign operations, which resulted in our ability to recognize the benefit of foreign net operating losses that were previously unrecognized, partially offset by increases in our valuation allowance, changes in uncertain tax positions and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Operating Earnings and Net Income The factors described above led to operating earnings of $557.7 million for fiscal 2016, or a 14.0% decrease from operating earnings of $648.2 million for fiscal 2015. Additionally, net income was $353.2 million for fiscal 2016, which represented a 12.3% decrease from net income of $402.8 million for fiscal 2015. SEGMENT PERFORMANCE We report our business in the following segments: Video Game Brands, which consists of four geographic segments in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, and Technology Brands. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance, the way in which our sales and profits are derived and how we divide management responsibility. Our sales and profits are driven through our physical stores which are highly integrated with our e-commerce, digital and mobile businesses. Due to this integration, our physical stores are the basis for our segment reporting. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products), new and pre-owned mobile devices and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments. 28 With our presence in international markets, we have operations in several foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and the Norwegian kroner. Operating earnings (loss) by operating segment, defined as income from operations before intercompany royalty fees, net interest expense and income taxes, and net sales by reportable segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2018 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 5,749.9 $ 434.9 $ 702.2 $ 1,534.0 $ 803.6 $ 9,224.6 Operating earnings (loss) $ 344.9 $ 18.5 $ 34.9 $ 53.0 $ (315.7 ) $ 135.6 Segment Operating data: Store count 3,864 321 467 1,247 1,377 7,276 Comparable store sales (1) 4.3 % 10.0 % 8.2 % 9.5 % n/a 5.8 % As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2017 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 5,488.9 $ 382.0 $ 609.5 $ 1,313.5 $ 814.0 $ 8,607.9 Operating earnings $ 430.2 $ 22.4 $ 34.9 $ 26.0 $ 44.2 $ 557.7 Segment Operating data: Store count 3,944 322 464 1,283 1,522 7,535 Comparable store sales (1) (13.5 )% (12.6 )% (2.0 )% (2.7 )% n/a (11.0 )% As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2016 United States Canada Australia Europe Technology Brands Consolidated Net sales $ 6,435.1 $ 446.6 $ 591.4 $ 1,356.7 $ 534.0 $ 9,363.8 Operating earnings $ 504.3 $ 29.4 $ 38.7 $ 48.8 $ 27.0 $ 648.2 Segment Operating data: Store count 4,013 325 444 1,299 1,036 7,117 Comparable store sales (1) 4.8 % 9.8 % 7.5 % (0.8 )% n/a 4.3 % ___________________ (1) Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales as we do not consider it to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. Instead, we measure the performance of our Technology Brands stores by using comparable store gross profit, which is calculated using a similar methodology as comparable store sales, but replacing sales with gross profit in the calculation. The comparable store gross profit for our Technology Brands stores declined 13.1% during the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Video Game Brands United States Segment results for Video Game Brands in the United States include retail GameStop operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.thinkgeek.com, Game Informer magazine and Kongregate, a web and mobile gaming platform which we sold in July 2017. Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $261.0 million , or 4.8% , compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the 4.3% increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $89.3 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch as well as increases in sales of collectibles and video game accessories. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of sales in pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased $85.3 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by declines in gross margin due to a shift in product mix from higher margin pre-owned products to lower margin products, such as hardware, and declines in gross margin rates in several product categories as described previously. 29 Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce in Canada. Net sales in the Canadian segment for fiscal 2017 increased $52.9 million , or 13.8% , compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily due to a increase in comparable store sales of 10.0% , the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $11.6 million and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $6.4 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch as well as an increase in sales of collectibles, partially offset by a decline in sales of pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased $3.9 million , or 17.4% primarily driven by a decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales associated with a decline in pre-owned and value video game sales and their gross margin. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales in the Australian segment for fiscal 2017 increased $92.7 million , or 15.2% , compared to fiscal 2016 . The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the increase in comparable store sales of 8.2% , the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $20.6 million , the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $10.1 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch and an increase in the sales of collectibles. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 were relatively flat at $34.9 million when compared to prior year, as a result of declines in gross profit as a percentage of sales due to a shift in product mix. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail and e-commerce operations in 10 European countries. Net sales in the European segment for fiscal 2017 increased $220.5 million , or 16.8% , compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the 9.5% increase in comparable store sales, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $72.4 million and the impact of 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $25.1 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch and an increase in sales of collectibles, video game accessories and pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 increased by $27.0 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in net sales and a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name recorded in fiscal 2016. Technology Brands Segment results for Technology Brands include our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket Wireless branded stores and Simply Mac stores, all of which operate in the United States. Cricket Wireless was sold in January 2018. Net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased $10.4 million , or 1.3% , and comparable store gross profit declined by 13.1% compared to fiscal 2016 . The decline in sales and comparable gross profit were the result of a slowdown in the wireless upgrade cycle and changes in commission income during fiscal 2017. The decline in sales was partially offset by an increase associated with acquisition activity in the second half of fiscal 2016 and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased $359.9 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to $388.1 million of asset impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The asset impairment charges are mainly related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill in our Spring Mobile business; see Note 6, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Video Game Brands United States Segment results for Video Game Brands in the United States include retail GameStop operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.thinkgeek.com, Game Informer magazine and Kongregate, our leading platform for web and mobile gaming, which we sold in July 2017. Net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $946.2 million, or 14.7%, compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the 13.5% decrease in comparable store sales. This decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of decreases in video game hardware and software sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and the PlayStation VR. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $74.1 million compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales, partially offset by improved gross margin due to a shift in the mix of sales to higher margin categories and lower SG&A expenses. The decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily due to decreases to incentive compensation, store-related expenses and acquisition-related costs related to ThinkGeek incurred in the prior year. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce in Canada. Net sales in the Canadian segment for fiscal 2016 decreased $64.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales of 12.6%, driven by declines in video game hardware and software sales. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $7.0 million, or 23.8% primarily due to the decrease in net sales. This decrease was partially offset by the growth in collectibles sales in fiscal 2016. 30 Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales in the Australian segment for fiscal 2016 increased $18.1 million, or 3.1%, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to growth in sales of collectibles, driven by the opening of 21 new Zing branded collectible stores since the prior year, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $7.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of 2.0%, primarily driven by decreases in video game software sales. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with expanding our collectible store base. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 10 European countries and e-commerce operations in four countries. Net sales in the European segment for fiscal 2016 decreased $43.2 million, or 3.2%, compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the 2.7% decrease in comparable store sales and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $7.2 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases in video game hardware and software sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and the PlayStation VR. Operating earnings for the fiscal 2016 decreased by $22.8 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the decline in net sales, coupled with a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name. Technology Brands Segment results for the Technology Brands segment include our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and our Simply Mac business. Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $280.0 million, or 52.4%, compared to fiscal 2015, as a result of the continued acquisition activity and growth in store count. Operating earnings for fiscal 2016 increased $17.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in store count, operational improvements as stores opened in fiscal 2015 mature and greater profitability from stores acquired since the prior year. Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 include $43.4 million in store closure and impairment costs as we right-size our store portfolio following four years of acquisition activity. The costs include $19.8 million in store closure costs, $16.6 million in impairment charges of store-level property and equipment, and a $7.0 million impairment charge on our Simply Mac dealer agreements intangible asset. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our $420.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility together will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, store openings and remodeling activities and corporate capital allocation programs, including acquisitions, share or debt repurchases and the payment of dividends declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months. As of February 3, 2018 , we had total cash on hand of $864.4 million and an additional $412.6 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, repurchasing shares of our common stock or our outstanding debt obligations, as well as other transactions that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. Our cash on hand attributable to foreign operations totaled $357.1 million as of February 3, 2018 . Although we may, from time to time, evaluate strategies and alternatives with respect to the cash attributable to our foreign operations, we currently anticipate that this cash will remain in those foreign jurisdictions and it therefore may not be available for immediate use in the United States. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will enable us to meet our cash requirements in the next twelve months. Cash Flows During fiscal 2017 , cash provided by operations was $434.9 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $537.1 million in fiscal 2016 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $102.2 million was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and lower earnings in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2016 , cash provided by operations was $537.1 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $656.8 million in fiscal 2015 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $119.7 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in net income combined with a decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $99.6 million, due primarily to the timing of payments for income taxes and accounts payable when compared to fiscal 2015 . 31 Cash used in investing activities was $63.7 million in fiscal 2017 , $578.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $444.6 million in fiscal 2015 . The decline in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower acquisition activity and $55.0 million in proceeds primarily from the sale of Kongregate. Cash paid for acquisitions totaled $8.5 million in fiscal 2017 and $441.2 million in fiscal 2016, of which the significant majority was in our Technology Brands segment.  In fiscal 2016 , cash paid for acquisitions totaled $267.5 million , of which $126.0 million was used to acquire ThinkGeek and $141.5 million was used in our Technology Brands segment. Capital expenditures totaled $113.4 million , $142.7 million and $173.2 million in fiscal 2017 , fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. In fiscal 2017 , our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $202.5 million consisting primarily of dividends paid of $155.2 million and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $21.8 million . Cash provided by financing activities was $238.7 million in fiscal 2016 and cash used in fiscal 2015 was $346.2 million . The cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of $466.9 million in proceeds, net of financing costs, from the issuance of our 2021 Senior Notes, offset by dividends paid of $155.5 million and share repurchases of $63.1 million . The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 were primarily for the repurchase of $194.3 million of common shares and the payment of dividends on our Class A Common Stock of $154.1 million . Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. On November 20, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to our asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Amended Revolver"). The Amended Revolver increased the borrowing base capacity to $420 million and extended the maturity date from March 2019 to November 2022. The Amended Revolver maintains the existing $200 million expansion feature and $50 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans were reduced from a range of 0.25% to 0.75% to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% and, for London Interbank Offered ("LIBO") rate loans, reduced from a range of 1.25% to 1.75% to a range of 1.25% to 1.50%. Other terms and covenants under the Amended Revolver remain substantially unchanged. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Amended Revolver. As of February 3, 2018 , the applicable margin was 0.25% for prime rate loans and 1.25% for LIBO rate loans. As of February 3, 2018 , total availability under the Amended Revolver was $412.6 million , with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.4 million . In March 2016, we issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.50% senior notes due October 1, 2019 (the "2019 Senior Notes," and together with the 2021 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. The agreement governing our Amended Revolver and the indentures governing our Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the indentures governing our Amended Revolver and Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Amended Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our indentures governing the Senior Notes and our Amended Revolver. See Note 9, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Amended Revolver and Senior Notes. Our Luxembourg subsidiary maintains a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the “Line of Credit”) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of February 3, 2018 , there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $9.8 million . 32 Capital Expenditures In fiscal 2018, our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million, primarily related to store remodels and our distribution and information systems. We plan to fund these capital expenditures from cash on hand and cash provided by operations. Share Repurchase Program We have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through open market transactions made from time to time. Shares repurchased are subsequently retired. In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing our management to repurchase up to $500 million of our Class A Common Stock with no expiration date, of which $170.2 million remained available under the program as of February 3, 2018 . We generally seek Board of Directors’ approval for a new authorization before the existing program is fully utilized to ensure we maintain availability under a repurchase program. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2017.  Share repurchase activity for fiscal 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in millions, except for per share data): Fiscal Year 2016 2015 Total number of shares purchased 3.0 5.2 Average price per share $ 24.94 $ 38.68 Aggregate value of shares purchased $ 75.1 $ 202.0 Dividends We paid cash dividends of $155.2 million , $155.5 million and $154.1 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . On February 20, 2018 , our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock, which remains unchanged from fiscal 2017. The first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2018 was payable on March 20, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 5, 2018. Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Our payment of dividends is and will continue to be restricted by or subject to, among other limitations, applicable provisions of federal and state laws, our earnings and various business considerations, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, our future business prospects, our status as a holding company and such other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the senior credit facility and of the indentures governing our Senior Notes restrict our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances as stated above. See Note 9, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our Senior Notes. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of February 3, 2018 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating leases $ 929.8 $ 377.2 $ 399.5 $ 114.3 $ 38.8 Purchase obligations (1) 591.5 591.3 0.2 — — 2019 Senior Notes 350.0 — 350.0 — — 2021 Senior Notes 475.0 — 475.0 — — Interest payments on senior notes 150.7 51.3 99.4 — — Contingent consideration (2) 12.2 12.2 — — — Total (3) $ 2,509.2 $ 1,032.0 $ 1,324.1 $ 114.3 $ 38.8 ___________________ (1) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (2) Contingent consideration relates to our acquisition of stores from an AT&T authorized retailer in fiscal 2016. As of February 3, 2018 , $12.2 million was included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets which was paid in the first quarter of 2018. (3) As of February 3, 2018 , we had $31.8 million of income tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability (and the timing of any related payments) cannot be reasonably determined and therefore these liabilities are excluded from the table above. In addition, certain payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. See Note 7, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our uncertain tax positions. 33 We lease retail stores, warehouse facilities, office space and equipment. These are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates through 2031 with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have been classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require us to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. As of February 3, 2018 , we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $7.4 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $25.5 million , $9.6 million of which are cash collateralized. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 3, 2018 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements, with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories Estimate Description. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value.  A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at February 3, 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2017. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors Estimate Description. We participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which our vendors provide us with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors’ products. The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs generally cover a period from a few weeks up to a month and include items such as product in-store display promotions and placement, internet advertising, co-op print advertising and other programs. The allowance for each event is negotiated with the vendor and requires specific performance by us to be earned. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a significant portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory rather than as an offset to our marketing and advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. We estimate the amount of vendor allowances to be deferred as a reduction of inventory based on the nature of the consideration received and the merchandise inventory to which the consideration relates. We apply a sell-through rate to determine the timing in which the consideration should be recognized in cost of sales. Consideration received that relates to video game products that have not yet been released to the public is deferred. 34 Potential Impact if Results Differ . Although we consider our advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances.  Additionally, if actual results are not consistent with our estimated deferrals and sell-through rates, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially impact our gross profit rates and inventory balances. A 10% difference in our vendor allowances deferral at February 3, 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2017. Customer Liabilities Estimate Description. Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts or merchandise. We estimate the net cost of the rewards that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost and the associated liability as points are earned by our loyalty program members. Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer or the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote, which is a concept known in the retail industry as breakage. We determine our gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average cost per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. A weighted-average cost per point redeemed is used to estimate future redemption costs. The weighted-average cost per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual costs incurred to fulfill points that have been redeemed by our loyalty program members and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. Potential Impact if Results Differ . We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average cost per point redeemed at February 3, 2018, in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2017. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 3, 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately $7.1 million in fiscal 2017. Goodwill Estimate Description. Goodwill results from acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. We are required to evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment are present. Our annual test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter, and interim tests are conducted when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As of February 3, 2018, our goodwill totaled $1.7 billion . See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for the allocation of our goodwill balance by reporting unit. In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess. Based on the results of our annual impairment test in fiscal 2017, the fair value of our United States reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value by 13%. The fair values of our Canada, Australia and Europe reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. We recognized goodwill impairment charges of $32.8 million in fiscal 2017 associated with Technology Brands. See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The discounted cash flows analyses utilize a five-year cash flow projection with a terminal value, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The projected cash flows include numerous assumptions such as, among others, future sales trends, operating margins, store count and capital expenditures, all of which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts. For our Video Game Brands reporting units, the projected sales trends include estimates related to the growth rate of the digital distribution of new video game software. For our Technology Brands, our projected sales are based on our current compensation structure with AT&T, which can be changed by AT&T with limited advanced notice. In addition, we corroborate the aggregate fair value of our reporting units with our market capitalization, which may impact certain assumptions in our discounted cash flows analyses. 35 Potential Impact if Results Differ . Variations in any of the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses may arrive at different estimated fair values that could result in a material impairment charge. Assuming all other factors unchanged, a 10% decrease in the projected net cash flows in each of our segments would result in impairment charges of approximately $5.0 million, $5.0 million, $20.0 million and $20.0 million in our United States, Australia, Europe and Technology Brands segments, respectively. Alternatively, assuming all other factors unchanged, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rates utilized in the tests of each our segments would result in an additional impairment charge of approximately $3.0 million in Technology Brands, with no impairment charges in the Video Game Brands segments. Sustained declines in our stock price and related market capitalization could impact key assumptions and the estimated fair values of our reporting units that could result in material goodwill impairment charges. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results, our assumptions or in our stock price. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Estimate Description. Indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded as a result of acquisitions and primarily consist of Spring Mobile's AT&T dealer agreements, Simply Mac's Apple dealer agreements, the Micromania trade name and the ThinkGeek trade name. As these intangible assets are expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely, they are not subject to amortization. We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year. We value our dealer agreements using a discounted cash flow analysis known as the Greenfield Method, which assumes that a business, at its inception, owns only dealer agreements and must make capital expenditure, working capital and other investments to ramp up its operations to a level that is comparable to its current operations. We value our trade names using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. As of February 3, 2018, our indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $126.3 million . As a result of our fiscal 2017 annual impairment testing, we recognized impairment charges totaling $339.8 million associated with our dealer agreements. Spring Mobile's AT&T dealer agreements were impaired by $328.8 million to reflect its estimated fair value of $77.0 million and Simply Mac's Apple dealer agreements were fully impaired by $11.0 million. See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing our dealer agreement assets, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the cash flows required to build a comparable operation and the available future cash flows from these operations. Specifically, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of capital expenditures to build a comparable operation, projected net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes, as well as the discount rate that is applied to the expected future cash flows to arrive at an estimated fair value. Projected sales are based on our current compensation structure with AT&T, which can be changed by AT&T with limited advanced notice. In valuing our trade names, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding future cash flow projections to ensure that such projections represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the royalty rate is applied. Additionally, management judgment is necessary in selecting an appropriate discount rate which is reflective of the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Changes in the projected cash flows and the assumptions utilized in estimating the present value of the cash flows attributable to dealer agreements and trade names could materially impact the fair value estimates, which would increase or decrease the impairment charges. Assuming all other factors unchanged, a 10% decrease in the projected net cash flows attributable to our dealer agreements would result in an increase in the impairment charge of approximately $42.2 million. Alternatively, assuming all other factors unchanged, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate utilized in the test of our dealer agreements would result in an increase in the impairment charge of approximately $28.2 million. Regarding our Micromania trade name, assuming all other factors unchanged, a 10% decline in sales in each forecast period, including the terminal period, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $4.0 million. Alternatively, assuming all other factors unchanged, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate utilized in the test of Micromania trade name would result in an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results or our assumptions. Income Taxes Estimate Description. We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $31.8 million as of February 3, 2018. 36 Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Our valuation allowance was $36.9 million as of February 3, 2018. See Note 7, "Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Additionally, several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), was signed into law significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S. corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We are required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and the re-measurement of deferred taxes as well as to re-assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the Tax Act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, IRS and other standard-setting bodies in the future, we have not completed our analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon our ongoing analysis of our data and tax positions along with the new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting standards and pronouncements.    

  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps (together, the “foreign currency contracts”) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 , we recognized a $24.6 million loss in selling, general and administrative expenses related to derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of the foreign currency contracts as of February 3, 2018 was a net liability of $7.5 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of February 3, 2018 would result in a gain or loss in value of the forwards, options and swaps of $11.5 million. 37 We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. Interest Rate Risk Our Revolver’s per annum interest rate is variable and is based on one of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) the LIBO rate or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. Our Senior Notes' per annum interest rate is fixed. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and we therefore believe that we do not have significant interest rate exposure.

   Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report") for further information. Unless otherwise noted, information in this Annual Report excludes our former Spring Mobile business. Reportable Segments We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Each segment consists primarily of retail operations, with the significant majority of our stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories. As of February 2, 2019 , we had a total of 5,830 stores across all of our segments; United States ( 3,846 ), Canada ( 311 ), Australia ( 462 ) and Europe ( 1,211 ). Our video game brands operate primarily under the names GameStop TM (“GameStop”), EB Games TM (“EB Games”) and Micromania. We operate e-commerce sites under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek. Our video game brands stores sell various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software and also sell collectible products. 1 Our segments also include 103 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers, with 62 collectibles stores in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture brand and 41 stores in the United States operating under the ThinkGeek brand. Our video game brands also include Game Informer TM (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication. Our former Technology Brands segment had been comprised of Spring Mobile, Simply Mac and Cricket Wireless branded stores ("Cricket Wireless"). Cricket Wireless was sold in January 2018 and Spring Mobile was sold in January 2019. Simply Mac and the historical results of Cricket Wireless are reported in the United States segment in this Annual Report. The historical results of Spring Mobile, including the gain on sale, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report. Simply Mac operates 43 Simply Mac© branded stores which sell Apple products, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smart phones and related accessories and other consumer electronic products.

   Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Market Size Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD"), International Development Group ("IDG") and DFC Intelligence ("DFC"), we estimate that the market for new physical video game products was approximately $18 billion in 2018 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $25 billion and $32 billion in 2018 . Merchandise We categorize our sale of products and services as follows: • New Video Game Hardware. We offer video game platforms from the major manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (March 2017). In 2016, Sony and Microsoft released refreshes to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively. In November 2017, Microsoft released a further enhanced version of its current generation console, the Xbox One X. We also offer extended service agreements. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. • New Video Game Software. We offer new video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. We are one of the largest retailers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We carry new video game software across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. • Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection of pre-owned video game titles. In the U.S., pre-owned video game software titles have an average price of $17, compared to an average price of $48 for new video game software titles, and  generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. • Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. • Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as full-game downloads and digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency, and we have developed technology to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency and DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. • Collectibles .  Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop culture themes which are sold through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com. 2 • Other Products. Other products primarily consist of PC entertainment software, gaming-related print media, mobile and consumer electronics, and revenues from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision Blizzard across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and interactive game figures, such as Amiibos from Nintendo. Store Operations We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,700 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us. Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Site Selection and Locations Site Selection. Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. In each of our segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations. Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the United States segment as of February 2, 2019 : Alabama 61 Kentucky 71 North Dakota 8 Alaska 6 Louisiana 61 Ohio 169 Arizona 73 Maine 11 Oklahoma 48 Arkansas 31 Maryland 83 Oregon 41 California 374 Massachusetts 78 Pennsylvania 179 Colorado 58 Michigan 101 Rhode Island 12 Connecticut 47 Minnesota 44 South Carolina 68 Delaware 15 Mississippi 44 South Dakota 11 Florida 242 Missouri 66 Tennessee 94 Georgia 137 Montana 12 Texas 374 Guam 2 Nebraska 21 Utah 32 Hawaii 17 Nevada 38 Vermont 4 Idaho 17 New Hampshire 26 Virginia 121 Illinois 143 New Jersey 114 Washington 76 Indiana 94 New Mexico 25 West Virginia 29 Iowa 31 New York 211 Wisconsin 56 Kansas 31 North Carolina 131 Wyoming 8 Total Domestic Stores 3,846 3 International Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our international stores included in the Video Game Brands segments in Canada, Europe and Australia as of February 2, 2019 : Number of Stores Canada 311 Total Stores - Canada Video Game Brands 311 Australia 419 New Zealand 43 Total Stores - Australia Video Game Brands 462 Austria 25 Denmark 34 Finland 16 France 420 Germany 208 Ireland 50 Italy 361 Norway 28 Sweden 52 Switzerland 17 Total Stores - Europe Video Game Brands 1,211 Total International Stores 1,984 Total Stores 5,830 PowerUp Rewards We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 39.6 million members as of February 2, 2019 , of which approximately 16.2 million members have purchased at GameStop in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals also include 5.6 million paying members and 20.5 million members that we market to on a regular basis. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 20.9 million members as of February 2, 2019 . Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products. Game Informer We publish Game Informer , the world’s largest print and digital video game publication and website featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fifth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2018 issue, the magazine had approximately 6.6 million paid subscribers, including more than 2.1 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Vendors We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from approximately 100 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors in our Video Game Brands segments accounted for approximately 78% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2018 . Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard accounted for 23% , 22% , 10% , 6% and 4% , respectively, of our new product purchases in our video game brands during fiscal 2018 . We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. 4 In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our distribution facilities and inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Competition The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2018 and 2017 , we generated approximately 37% and 39% , respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Zing Pop Culture,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 16,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 23,000 and 45,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit. Sustainability We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2018 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over five million pieces of software (CDs) and over three million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over  2.7 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure, and look for cost-effective ways to reduce, our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past seven years.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report, before you make an investment decision with respect to our company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Economic conditions in the U.S. and in certain international markets could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing video game products, when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of the Company's control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and civil disturbances. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The video game industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business. The video game industry has historically been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. In addition, the features of new consoles or changes to the existing generations of consoles, including any future restrictions or conditions or the ability to play prior generation video games on such consoles, may adversely affect our pre-owned business. The current generation console cycle began when Sony and Microsoft launched the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. Nintendo introduced the Nintendo Switch in March 2017. If the current video game platforms do not continue to be successful, our sales of video game products could decline. The introduction of new iterations or generations of consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business, which could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. We depend upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors. We depend on manufacturers and publishers to deliver video game hardware, software, and consumer electronics in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. In addition, we depend on these manufacturers and publishers to introduce new and innovative products and software titles to drive industry sales. We have experienced sales declines in the past due to a reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms or software titles could result in reduced sales. 6 If we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. The interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. The popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming has increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. In order to continue to compete effectively in the video game industry, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers’ preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to keep pace with these changes. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower our sales. The current consoles from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. In addition, disc-less consoles may be available to consumers in the near term from certain manufacturers. Downloading of video game content to the current generation video game systems continues to grow and take an increasing percentage of new video game sales. If consumers' preference for downloading video game content continues to increase or these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers’ ability to access and download the current format of video games and incremental content for their games through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase video games in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of game delivery. As a result, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our sales of collectibles depend on popularity of and trends in pop culture, and our ability to react to them. Our sales of collectibles are heavily dependent upon the continued demand by our customers for collectibles, apparel, toys, gadgets, electronics and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts. The popularity of such products is often driven by movies, television shows, music, fashion and other pop culture influences. The market for, and appeal of, particular types of music, movies, television shows, artists, actors, styles, trends and brands are constantly changing. Our failure to anticipate, identify and react appropriately to changing trends and preferences of customers could lead to, among other things, excess inventories and higher markdowns. There can be no assurance that the collectibles and related products that we sell will appeal to our customers. We depend on licensed products for a substantial portion of our sales of collectibles and our inability to maintain such licenses and obtain new licensed products would adversely affect our sales of collectibles. We license from others the rights to sell certain of our collectibles and many of these products contain a third party’s trademarks, designs and other intellectual property. If we are unable to maintain current licenses or obtain new licensed products with comparable consumer demand, our sales of collectibles would decline. Furthermore, we may not be able to prevent a licensor from choosing not to renew a license with us and/or from licensing a product to one of our competitors. Our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers may impact our financial results. Our financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors. Our largest vendors are Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard, which accounted for 23% , 22% , 10% , 6% and 4% , respectively, of our new product purchases in fiscal 2018 . If our suppliers do not provide us with favorable business terms, we may not be able to offer products to our customers at competitive prices. If our vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted. The manufacturers of video game hardware and software have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, we receive cooperative advertising and market development payments from these vendors which enable us to actively promote and merchandise the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. We cannot assure you that vendors will continue to provide this support at historical levels. If they fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. 7 Pressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which could decrease our profitability. The retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Wal-Mart and Target; computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy; internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com; other U.S. and international video game and PC software specialty stores located in malls and other locations, such as Carrefour and Media Markt; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and may have greater financial resources than we do or other advantages. In addition, video game products and content are increasingly being digitally distributed and new competitors built to take advantage of these new capabilities are entering the marketplace, and other methods may emerge in the future. We also compete with other sellers of pre-owned video game products and other PC software distribution companies, including Steam. Certain of our mass-merchant competitors are expanding in the market for new and pre-owned video games through aggressive pricing which may negatively affect our margins, sales and earnings for these products.  Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including browser, social and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, we may be less profitable. Failure to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key executives, management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or our failure to retain key executive officers and other employees in the future may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers. Our continued success depends upon customers' perception of our Company. Any negative publicity relating to our vendors, products, practices or our Company could damage our reputation. The increased use of social media platforms allows for the rapid dispersal of information, including negative feedback or other commentary, which could negatively impact our reputation and result in declines in customer loyalty and adversely affect our results of operations. International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. Our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our international operations expose us to numerous risks. We have international retail operations in Australia, Canada and Europe. Because release schedules for hardware and software introduction in these markets can sometimes differ from release schedules in the United States, the timing of increases and decreases in foreign sales may differ from the timing of increases and decreases in domestic sales. We are also subject to a number of other factors that may affect our current or future international operations. These include: • economic downturns, specifically in the regions in which we operate; • currency exchange rate fluctuations; • international incidents; • natural disasters; • government instability; and • competitors entering our current and potential markets. Our operations in Europe are also subject to risks associated with the current economic conditions and uncertainties in the European Union (“EU”). In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the exit of that country from the EU (“Brexit”). The Brexit vote and related developments have created significant economic uncertainty in Europe. In addition, European and global economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the inability of certain EU member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. There continues to be uncertainty over the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles, the ultimate outcome of the EU governments’ financial support programs, the possible breakup or restructuring of the EU and the possible elimination or restructuring of the EU monetary system. These continued uncertainties could further disrupt 8 European and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products. These factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business. Changes to tariff and import/export regulations may negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. The United States and other countries have from time to time proposed and enacted protectionist trade policies that could increase the cost or reduce the availability of certain merchandise. In particular, the current U.S. administration has made certain changes to import/export tariffs and international trade agreements. The changes announced and made to date do not impact the merchandise that we offer. Any measures that could impact the cost or availability of the merchandise we offer could have an adverse impact on our business because a significant portion of the products we offer are purchased from foreign vendors and manufactured in foreign countries. Unfavorable changes in our global tax rate could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be higher than other companies or higher than our tax rates have been in the past. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our business and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. A change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any jurisdiction in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of our operations. Restrictions on our ability to purchase and sell pre-owned video game products or pre-owned mobile devices could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results depend on our ability to purchase and sell pre-owned video game products and pre-owned mobile devices within our stores. Actions by manufacturers or publishers of video game products or mobile devices, wireless carriers or governmental authorities to prohibit or limit our ability to purchase or sell pre-owned video game products or mobile devices, or to limit the ability of consumers to play pre-owned video games or use pre-owned mobile devices, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Sales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and our financial results may be adversely affected as a result. Many popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an “M” or “T” rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations. An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2018 , we generated approximately 37% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • the timing of new store openings or closings; 9 • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; and • changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. Failure to successfully transfer customers and sales from closed stores due to under performance to nearby stores could adversely impact our financial results. We regularly assess stores for closure that are not meeting performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms with the intent of transferring sales to other nearby locations. We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue may be adversely affected. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion. We rely on centralized facilities for refurbishment of our pre-owned products. Any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on centralized facilities for the refurbishment of many of the pre-owned products that we sell. If any disruption occurred at these facilities, whether due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, systems failures, or other unforeseen causes, sales of our pre-owned products could decrease. Since we generally obtain higher margins on our pre-owned products, any adverse effect on their sales could adversely affect our profitability. If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our distribution centers, as well as to communicate distribution information to the off-site, third-party operated distribution centers with which we work. The third-party distribution centers pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles and deliver them to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores at least twice a week, to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform their functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted or if these centers were unable to accommodate stores in a particular region, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. 10 If we do not maintain the security of our member, customer, employee or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. An important part of our business involves the receipt, processing and storage of personal information of our customers, members and employees, including, in the case of customers, payment information. We have systems and processes in place that are designed to protect against security and data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information.  Nevertheless, cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Techniques or software used to gain unauthorized access, and/or disable, degrade or harm our systems may be difficult to detect for prolonged periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or put in place protective or preventive measures. These attempts to gain unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. If individuals are successful in infiltrating, breaking into, disrupting, damaging or otherwise stealing from the computer systems of the Company or its third-party providers, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, including interruptions in our ability to accept payment from customers and our ability to issue and redeem loyalty points under our Power Up Rewards program. Such an event may also expose us to costly litigation, government investigations, government enforcement actions, fines and/or lawsuits and may significantly harm our reputation with our members and customers. We are continuously working to upgrade our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to protect our member, customer, employee, and company data against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against future data security breaches. While past cybersecurity attacks have not resulted in material losses, a data security breach or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could materially impact our business and our results of operations.  Moreover, a data security breach or change in applicable privacy or security laws or regulations could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the breach or such change in laws or regulations and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard against such breaches or to comply with such change in laws or regulations, which could disrupt our business, operations and financial condition. If our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, our business may be adversely affected and we may lose market confidence in our reported financial information which could adversely impact our business and stock price. Effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in internal control related to the principles associated with the control activities component of the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) , specifically related to our information technology general control environment. Refer to Part II,    

 Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for additional information. 12 Risks Relating to Indebtedness Because of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our senior credit facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The terms of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The terms of our Senior Notes and our senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us in certain circumstances. These restrictions, among other things, limit our ability to: • incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guaranty obligations; • incur liens or agree to negative pledges in other agreements; • engage in sale and leaseback transactions; • make loans and investments; • declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock; • engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations; • prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; • amend or otherwise alter the terms of our organizational documents and indebtedness; • sell assets; and • engage in transactions with affiliates. We cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures for the Senior Notes, or under our senior credit facility, could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applied. In addition, an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. See Note 10, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made under our senior credit facility or to holders of our Senior Notes, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or if that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments, then in effect. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those sales and raise debt or equity to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance would also depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 13 Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage. We are able to incur additional indebtedness. Although our senior credit facility and the indentures for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Such future indebtedness or obligations may have restrictions similar to, or more restrictive than, those included in the indentures for our Senior Notes or our senior credit facility. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could impact our financial condition and results of operations.   

 Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein for further information regarding restrictions on our dividend payments. Stock Comparative Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A Common Stock for the period commencing January 31, 2014 through February 1, 2019 (the last trading date of fiscal 2018 ) with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (the “S&P 500”) and the Dow Jones Retailers, Other Specialty Industry Group Index (the “Dow Jones Specialty Retailers Index”) over the same period. Total return values were calculated based on cumulative total return assuming (i) the investment of $100 in our Class A Common Stock, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Specialty Retailers Index on January 31, 2014 and (ii) reinvestment of dividends.

The historical results of Spring Mobile, including the gain on sale, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. (2) In fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $795.6 million , $28.8 million , $66.4 million and $79.9 million for the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe segments, respectively. See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) Asset impairment charges primarily relate to intangible assets and store-level property and equipment. We recognized intangible asset impairment charges totaling $43.1 million , $11.0 million and $14.4 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. (4) The sum of (loss) earnings per share for continuing operations and discontinued operations may not necessarily total to consolidated (loss) earnings per share as amounts are calculated based on whole numbers. (5) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our video game brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales compares the fiscal year ended to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (6) Net working capital excludes held-for-sale assets and liabilities related to our Spring Mobile business, which was sold in January 2019. (7) In March 2016, we issued $475 million aggregate principal of 6.75% unsecured senior notes due in March 2021. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal of 5.50% unsecured senior notes due in October 2019. On March 4, 2019, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of our 2019 Senior Notes on April 4, 2019.

Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a global, multichannel video game and consumer electronics retailer. We operate over 5,800 stores across 14 countries. Our consumer product network also includes www.gamestop.com; Game Informer® magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication; and ThinkGeek, www.thinkgeek.com, the premier retailer for the global geek community featuring exclusive and unique video game and pop culture products, and Simply Mac, which sells the full line of Apple products, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones and offers Apple certified warranty and repair services. We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our former Technology Brands segment had been comprised of Spring Mobile, Simply Mac and Cricket Wireless branded stores ("Cricket Wireless"). Cricket Wireless was sold in January 2018, and Spring Mobile was sold in January 2019. Simply Mac and the historical results of Cricket Wireless are reported in the United States segment in this Annual Report. The historical results of Spring Mobile, including the gain on sale, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report. The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2018 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 2, 2019 ("fiscal 2018 "). Fiscal year 2017 consisted of the 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2018 ("fiscal 2017 ") and fiscal year 2016 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2017 ("fiscal 2016 "). Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. Gaming consoles are typically launched in cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in graphics, audio quality, game play, internet connectivity and other entertainment capabilities beyond video gaming. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (March 2017). In 2016, Sony and Microsoft released refreshes to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively, and Sony also released the PlayStation VR. In November 2017, Microsoft released a further enhanced version of its current generation console, the Xbox One X. The sale of video games delivered through digital channels and other forms of gaming continue to grow and take an increasing percentage of physical video game sales. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), full-game downloads, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We have made significant investments in e-commerce and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to conveniently access digital content to facilitate the digital sales and delivery process. We continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category. In our discussion of the results of operations, we refer to comparable store sales, which is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our video game brands stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales compares the fiscal year ended to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer that provides its consumers several ways to access its products. 19 STORE COUNT INFORMATION The following table presents the number of stores and the number of stores opened, acquired and closed during fiscal 2018 : February 3, 2018 Opened/Acquired Disposed February 2, 2019 Video Game Stores 5,796 24 (136 ) 5,684 Collectibles Stores 103 4 (4 ) 103 Simply Mac 48 — (5 ) 43 Total Stores 5,947 28 (145 ) 5,830 SEASONALITY Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain statement of operations items (in millions) and as a percentage of net sales, for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Net sales $ 8,285.3 100.0 % $ 8,547.1 100.0 % $ 7,965.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 5,977.2 72.1 6,062.2 70.9 5,465.1 68.6 Gross profit 2,308.1 27.9 2,484.9 29.1 2,499.9 31.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,888.6 22.9 1,909.6 22.4 1,861.9 23.4 Depreciation and amortization 105.6 1.3 122.3 1.4 136.7 1.7 Goodwill impairments 970.7 11.7 — — — — Asset impairments 45.2 0.5 13.8 0.2 19.6 0.2 Operating (loss) earnings (702.0 ) (8.5 ) 439.2 5.1 481.7 6.1 Interest expense, net 51.1 0.6 55.3 0.6 53.0 0.7 (Loss) earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (753.1 ) (9.1 ) 383.9 4.5 428.7 5.4 Income tax expense 41.7 0.5 153.5 1.8 124.2 1.6 Net (loss) income from continuing operations (794.8 ) (9.6 ) 230.4 2.7 304.5 3.8 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 121.8 1.5 (195.7 ) (2.3 ) 48.7 0.6 Net (loss) income $ (673.0 ) (8.1 )% $ 34.7 0.4 % $ 353.2 4.4 % We include certain purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in the statement of operations. We include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales in the statement of operations. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in SG&A. The net effect of these classifications as a percentage of sales has not historically been material. 20 The following tables set forth, by significant product category, net sales and gross profit information for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales New video game hardware (1) $ 1,767.8 21.3 % $ 1,791.8 21.0 % $ 1,396.7 17.5 % New video game software 2,449.7 29.6 2,582.0 30.2 2,493.4 31.3 Pre-owned and value video game products 1,866.3 22.5 2,149.6 25.2 2,254.1 28.3 Video game accessories 956.5 11.5 784.3 9.2 676.7 8.5 Digital 194.0 2.3 189.2 2.2 181.0 2.3 Collectibles 707.5 8.5 636.2 7.4 494.1 6.2 Other (2) 343.5 4.3 414.0 4.8 469.0 5.9 Total $ 8,285.3 100.0 % $ 8,547.1 100.0 % $ 7,965.0 100.0 % Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent Gross Profit Gross Profit Percent New video game hardware (1) $ 150.0 8.5 % $ 163.1 9.1 % $ 154.2 11.0 % New video game software 525.6 21.5 590.3 22.9 600.4 24.1 Pre-owned and value video game products 810.4 43.4 977.1 45.5 1,044.1 46.3 Video game accessories 312.5 32.7 255.0 32.5 235.2 34.8 Digital 171.6 88.5 162.4 85.8 155.5 85.9 Collectibles 233.3 33.0 208.2 32.7 171.6 34.7 Other (2) 104.7 30.5 128.8 31.1 138.9 29.6 Total $ 2,308.1 27.9 % $ 2,484.9 29.1 % $ 2,499.9 31.4 % ___________________ (1) Includes sales of hardware bundles, in which physical hardware and digital or physical software are sold together as a single SKU.

The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to fiscal 2017 including 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2018, the impact of 117 store closures (net of openings), the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a decrease in comparable stores sales of 0.3% . Sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $132.7 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of pre-owned and value video game products and new video game software, partially offset by an increase in sales of video game accessories and collectibles. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the following: • Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased $283.3 million , or 13.2% , for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Pre-owned and value video game product sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $37.7 million. The decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decline in pre-owned software, partially offset by an increase in sales of pre-owned hardware. The decline in pre-owned software sales is primarily due to fewer new title releases and a decline in new video game software sales in the first six months of fiscal 2018, which affects pre-owned inventory levels, weakening demand as a result of increasing digital adoption, including digital access to older titles, and lower promotional activity in fiscal 2018. • New video game software sales decreased $132.3 million , or 5.1% , for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. New video game software sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $36.4 million. The decline was primarily due to weaker new title releases in the first six months of fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of Nintendo Switch titles due to the expansion of the hardware install base and the increase of new release titles. The decreases described above were partially offset by the following: • Video game accessories increased $172.2 million , or 22.0% , for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, due to growth in sales of audio-related and other accessories primarily associated with the battle royale gaming genre. • Collectibles sales increased $71.3 million , or 11.2% , for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by new and improved product offerings. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased $85.0 million , or 1.4% , in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the change in net sales discussed above as well as the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $176.8 million , or 7.1% , in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to 29.1% in fiscal 2017 . Gross profit for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 was approximately $34.7 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by decreases of $166.7 million in pre-owned and value video game products and $64.7 million in new video game software, which were partially offset by increases of $57.5 million in video game accessories and $25.1 million in collectibles. The net decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to product mix shift between categories and the following product margin rate variances: • Pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 43.4% in fiscal 2018 from 45.5% in fiscal 2017 due to a greater mix of sales of pre-owned hardware, which carry lower gross margin than pre-owned software. • New video game software decreased to 21.5% in fiscal 2018 from 22.9% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher promotional activity in the fiscal 2018 holiday season. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased $21.0 million , or 1.1% , in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $16.7 million , or 13.7% , in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to declining capital expenditures over the past several years. 23 Goodwill and Asset Impairments During fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $970.7 million and asset impairment charges totaling $45.2 million . The impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization and lower forecasted cash flows. During fiscal 2017, we recognized asset impairment charges of $13.8 million, which was primarily comprised of an $11.0 million impairment of our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during fiscal 2017. See Note 7, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Income Tax Income tax expense was $41.7 million , representing an effective tax rate of (5.5)% in fiscal 2018 , compared to $153.5 million , representing an effective tax rate of 40.0% in fiscal 2017 . The decrease in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by non-deductible impairment charges, the settlement of the tax dispute in France, tax reform, revisions to transition taxes and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions within which we operate. See Note 8, "Income Taxes," and Note 12, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. Operating (Loss) Earnings and Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations The factors described above led to an operating loss of $702.0 million for fiscal 2018 , compared to operating earnings of $439.2 million for fiscal 2017 . Net loss from continuing operations was $794.8 million for fiscal 2018 compared to net income from continuing operations of $230.4 million for fiscal 2017 . Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax On January 16, 2019, we completed the previously announced sale of all of the equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary Spring Communications Holding, Inc. ("Spring Mobile") to Prime Acquisition Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prime Communications, L.P., pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of November 21, 2018. The net cash proceeds received from the sale totaled $727.9 million , which is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain on sale of $100.8 million ( $65.4 million , net of tax) during fiscal 2018. The historical results of Spring Mobile, including the gain on sale, is reported as discontinued operations. Except for customary post-closing adjustments and transition services, we have no contingencies or continuing involvement with Spring Mobile subsequent to the completion of the sale. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $121.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $195.7 million in fiscal 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale, net of tax, of $65.4 million . Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2017 includes goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $377.0 million.

Net Sales Net sales increased $582.1 million , or 7.3% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $132.7 million. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable store sales of 5.8% compared to the prior year and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $104.6 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily the result of an increase in sales of new video game hardware, collectibles, video game accessories and new video game software. The increase in sales in collectibles are a result of the Company's diversification strategy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales in pre-owned and value video game products. The increase in net sales was due to the following: • New video game hardware sales increased $395.1 million, or 28.3%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the launch of the Nintendo Switch in March 2017, which was partially offset by decreases in sales of other consoles as their cycles mature. • Collectibles sales increased $142.1 million, or 28.8%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due to the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. • Video game accessories increased $107.6 million, or 15.9%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recent release of the Nintendo Switch. • New video game software sales increased $88.6 million, or 3.6%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recent release of the Nintendo Switch. The increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in pre-owned and value video game product sales of $104.5 million, or 4.6%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles mainly in the first half of the current fiscal year. 25 Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased $597.1 million , or 10.9 %, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the change in net sales discussed above as well as the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $15.0 million , or 0.6% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 29.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to 31.4% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross profit was driven by decreases of $67.0 million in pre-owned and value video game products and $10.1 million in new video game software, partially offset by increases of $36.6 million in collectibles and $19.8 million in video game accessories. The net decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories and the following product margin rate variances: • New video game hardware decreased to 9.1% in fiscal 2017 from 11.0% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix shift in console sales. • New video game software decreased to 22.9% in fiscal 2017 from 24.1% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower cooperative advertising funds as a percentage of sales combined with higher promotional activity in the fiscal 2017 holiday season. • Pre-owned and value video game products decreased to 45.5% in fiscal 2017 from 46.3% in fiscal 2016 due to a greater mix of sales of current generation products, which carry lower gross margin than previous generation products. • Video game accessories decreased to 32.5% in fiscal 2017 from 34.8% in fiscal 2016, due to a shift in product mix including PlayStation VR which carry lower margin. • Collectibles decreased to 32.7% in fiscal 2017 from 34.7% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased promotional activity in the fiscal 2017 holiday season. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased $47.7 million , or 2.6% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $14.4 million , or 10.5% , in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to certain corporate assets being fully depreciated and certain intangible assets being fully amortized. Asset Impairments During fiscal 2017, we recorded asset impairment charges of $13.8 million, primarily associated with the impairment of Simply Mac's dealer agreement intangible asset. In fiscal 2016, we recognized asset impairment charges primarily consisting of a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name intangible asset, and a $7.0 million impairment to our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset and $5.2 million impairment to store-level property and equipment . The Micromania trade name is associated with our operations in France. Income Tax Income tax expense was $153.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 40.0% in fiscal 2017, compared to $124.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.0% in fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by tax reform, the impairment of goodwill, changes in uncertain tax positions and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Refer to Note 8, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Operating Earnings and Net Income from Continuing Operations The factors described above led to operating earnings of $439.2 million for fiscal 2017, or an 8.8% decrease from operating earnings of $481.7 million for fiscal 2016. Additionally, net income from continuing operations was $230.4 million for fiscal 2017, which represented a 24.3% decrease from net income from continuing operations of $304.5 million for fiscal 2016. The impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 was an increase to operating earnings of approximately $12.0 million. 26 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE We report our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance, the way in which our sales and profits are derived and how we divide management responsibility. Our sales and profits are driven through our physical stores which are highly integrated with our e-commerce, digital and mobile businesses. Due to this integration, our physical stores are the basis for our segment reporting. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products). These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments. With our presence in international markets, we have operations in several foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and the Norwegian kroner. Operating earnings (loss) by operating segment, defined as income from operations before intercompany royalty fees, net interest expense and income taxes, and net sales by reportable segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2019 United States Canada Australia Europe Consolidated Net sales $ 5,800.2 $ 434.5 $ 645.4 $ 1,405.2 $ 8,285.3 Goodwill impairments $ 795.6 $ 28.8 $ 66.4 $ 79.9 $ 970.7 Operating loss $ (533.9 ) $ (19.3 ) $ (46.5 ) $ (102.3 ) $ (702.0 ) Segment Operating data: Store count 3,846 311 462 1,211 5,830 Comparable store sales 1.8 % 3.1 % (3.4 )% (7.7 )% (0.3 )% As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2018 United States Canada Australia Europe Consolidated Net sales $ 5,876.0 $ 434.9 $ 702.2 $ 1,534.0 $ 8,547.1 Operating earnings $ 332.8 $ 18.5 $ 34.9 $ 53.0 $ 439.2 Segment Operating data: Store count 3,912 321 467 1,247 5,947 Comparable store sales 4.3 % 10.0 % 8.2 % 9.5 % 5.8 % As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2017 United States Canada Australia Europe Consolidated Net sales $ 5,660.0 $ 382.0 $ 609.5 $ 1,313.5 $ 7,965.0 Operating earnings $ 398.4 $ 22.4 $ 34.9 $ 26.0 $ 481.7 Segment Operating data: Store count 4,063 322 464 1,283 6,132 Comparable store sales (13.5 )% (12.6 )% (2.0 )% (2.7 )% (11.0 )% Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Video Game Brands United States Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states and Guam; our e-commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.thinkgeek.com; Game Informer magazine; Simply Mac; Kongregate, a web and mobile gaming platform which we sold in July 2017; and Cricket Wireless, which we sold in January 2018. Net sales for fiscal 2018 decreased $75.8 million , or 1.3% , compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $91.1 million, the impact of 66 store closures (net of openings) and the divestiture of our Cricket Wireless stores in January 2018; which were partially offset by a 1.8% increase in comparable store sales. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by increases in sales of video game accessories, new video game hardware and collectibles. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of pre-owned and value video game products and new video game software. 27 The operating loss for fiscal 2018 was $533.9 million compared to operating earnings of $332.8 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss in fiscal 2018 includes goodwill impairment charges totaling $795.6 million and an intangible asset charge of $11.2 million . Excluding these impairment charges, operating earnings would have declined to $272.9 million for fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the decline in net sales and gross margin, which were partially offset by lower SG&A expense. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin categories and higher promotional activity in fiscal 2018. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce in Canada. Net sales of $434.5 million for fiscal 2018 was essentially flat compared to net sales of $434.9 million in fiscal 2017 . Comparable store sales increased by 3.1% , which was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $9.2 million and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $6.4 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by increases in sales of collectibles and video game accessories, partially offset by a decline in sales of pre-owned and value video game products and new video game hardware. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 was $19.3 million compared to operating earnings of $18.5 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 includes goodwill impairment charges totaling $28.8 million . Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, operating earnings would have declined to $9.5 million for fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of a decline in gross profit due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin categories and higher SG&A driven by government-mandated pay increases. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales for fiscal 2018 decreased $56.8 million , or 8.1% , compared to fiscal 2017 . The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $30.6 million, the decrease in comparable store sales of 3.4% and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $10.1 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases in the sales of new video game software, new video game hardware, collectibles and pre-owned and value video game products; partially offset by an increase in sales of video game accessories. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 was $46.5 million compared to operating earnings of $34.9 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 includes goodwill impairment charges totaling $66.4 million . Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, operating earnings would have declined to $19.9 million for fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the decline in net sales. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail and e-commerce operations in 10 European countries. Net sales for fiscal 2018 decreased $128.8 million , or 8.4% , compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the 7.7% decrease in comparable store sales and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $25.1 million, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $13.6 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases in sales of new video game hardware, new video game software and pre-owned and value video game products, partially offset by an increase in collectibles sales. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 was $102.3 million compared to operating earnings of $53.0 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss for fiscal 2018 includes goodwill impairment charges totaling $79.9 million , an intangible asset impairment charge of $31.9 million and the write-off of an investment asset of $6.8 million. Excluding these charges, operating earnings would have declined to $16.3 million for fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the decline in net sales and higher SG&A expense driven by government-mandates pay increases. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 United States Segment results for Video Game Brands in the United States include retail GameStop operations in 50 states and Guam, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.thinkgeek.com, Game Informer magazine; Simply Mac; Kongregate, a web and mobile gaming platform which we sold in July 2017; and Cricket Wireless, which we sold in January 2018. Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $216.0 million, or 3.8%, compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the 4.3% increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $91.1 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch as well as increases in sales of collectibles and video game accessories. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of sales in pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased $65.6 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by declines in gross margin due to a shift in product mix from higher margin pre-owned products to lower margin products, such as hardware, and declines in gross margin rates in several product categories as described previously. 28 Canada Segment results for Canada include retail and e-commerce in Canada. Net sales in the Canadian segment for fiscal 2017 increased $52.9 million, or 13.8%, compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to a increase in comparable store sales of 10.0%, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $11.6 million and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $6.4 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch as well as an increase in sales of collectibles, partially offset by a decline in sales of pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased $3.9 million, or 17.4% primarily driven by a decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales associated with a decline in pre-owned and value video game sales and their gross margin. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail and e-commerce operations in Australia and New Zealand. Net sales in the Australian segment for fiscal 2017 increased $92.7 million, or 15.2%, compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the increase in comparable store sales of 8.2%, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $20.6 million, the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $10.1 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch and an increase in the sales of collectibles. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 were relatively flat at $34.9 million when compared to prior year, as a result of declines in gross profit as a percentage of sales due to a shift in product mix. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail and e-commerce operations in 10 European countries. Net sales in the European segment for fiscal 2017 increased $220.5 million, or 16.8%, compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the 9.5% increase in comparable store sales, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $72.4 million and the impact of 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $25.1 million. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch and an increase in sales of collectibles, video game accessories and pre-owned and value video game products. Operating earnings for fiscal 2017 increased by $27.0 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in net sales and a $7.4 million impairment of our Micromania trade name recorded in fiscal 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview In September 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors was conducting a comprehensive review of strategic and financial alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including, but not limited to, a potential sale of the Company. On January 29, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors terminated its efforts to pursue a sale of the Company. As of April 2, 2019, our Board of Directors has concluded its formal review of strategic and financial alternatives. In connection with this review, we have taken the following actions: • On January 16, 2019, we completed the sale of Spring Mobile for cash proceeds of $727.9 million, net of transaction costs and preliminary adjustments; • On March 4, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new $300.0 million share repurchase authorization to replace the previous share repurchase authorization, which had $170.2 million remaining; and • We issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of our $350.0 million unsecured senior notes due October 2019. The redemption date will be April 4, 2019, and we expect to use cash on hand. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, repurchasing shares of our common stock or our outstanding debt obligations, as well as other transactions that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. As of February 2, 2019 , we had total cash on hand of $1.6 billion and an additional $385.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our cash on hand attributable to foreign operations totaled $288.6 million as of February 2, 2019 .  Although we may, from time to time, evaluate strategies and alternatives with respect to the cash attributable to our foreign operations, we currently anticipate that this cash will remain in those foreign jurisdictions and it therefore may not be available for immediate use in the United States. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our $420.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility together will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, store openings and remodeling activities and corporate capital allocation programs, share and debt repurchases and the payment of dividends (if any) declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months. 29 Cash Flows During fiscal 2018 , cash provided by operations was $325.1 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $434.9 million in fiscal 2017 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $109.8 million was primarily due to lower earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2017 , cash provided by operations was $434.9 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $537.1 million in fiscal 2016 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $102.2 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and lower earnings in fiscal 2017. Cash provided by investing activities was $635.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to cash used in investing activities of $60.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $577.4 million in fiscal 2016 . The increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the $727.9 million in proceeds from the sale of Spring Mobile. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016 was due to lower acquisition activity and $55.0 million in proceeds from the sale of Kongregate in fiscal 2017. Cash paid for acquisitions totaled $8.5 million in fiscal 2017 and $441.2 million in fiscal 2016 of which the significant majority was related to the Spring Mobile business. We had no acquisitions in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures totaled $93.7 million , $113.4 million and $142.7 million in fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. In fiscal 2018 , our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $174.7 million consisting primarily of dividends paid of $157.4 million and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $12.2 million . The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of dividends paid of $155.2 million, the settlement of share repurchases of $22.0 million that were initiated in fiscal 2016  and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $21.8 million. The cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of $466.9 million in proceeds, net of financing costs, from the issuance of our 2021 Senior Notes, partially offset by dividends paid of $155.5 million and share repurchases of $63.1 million. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022. The Revolver has a $200 million expansion feature and $50 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans range from 0.25% to 0.50% and, for London Interbank Offered ("LIBO") rate loans, range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Amended Revolver. As of February 2, 2019 , the applicable margin was 0.25% for prime rate loans and 1.25% for LIBO rate loans. As of February 2, 2019 , total availability under the Revolver was $385.1 million , with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.2 million . In March 2016, we issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. In September 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.50% senior notes due October 1, 2019 (the "2019 Senior Notes," and together with the 2021 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. On March 4, 2019, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of our $350.0 million unsecured senior notes due October 2019. The redemption date will be April 4, 2019 and the redemption price will be equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, representing 100.0% of the aggregate principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest. We expect to use cash on hand for the redemption of the 2019 Senior Notes. The agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the indentures governing our Revolver and Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our indentures governing the Senior Notes and our Revolver. See Note 10, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Revolver and Senior Notes. 30 Our Luxembourg subsidiary maintains a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the “Line of Credit”) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of February 2, 2019 , there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $9.4 million . Share Repurchase Program From time to time, we have repurchased our common shares through open market transactions under share repurchase authorizations approved by our Board of Directors. We have not repurchased any shares of common stock since fiscal 2016. Our share repurchase authorizations do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time. Shares repurchased have been subsequently retired. On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization allowing our management to repurchase up to $300 million of our Class A Common Stock with no expiration date. The new share repurchase authorization replaces the previous share repurchase authorization, which had $170.2 million remaining. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.  Share repurchase activity for fiscal 2016 is as follows (in millions, except for per share data): Fiscal Year 2016 Total number of shares purchased 3.0 Average price per share $ 24.94 Aggregate value of shares purchased $ 75.1 Dividends We paid cash dividends of $157.4 million , $155.2 million and $155.5 million in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . On March 4, 2019 , our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock. The first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2019 was paid on March 29, 2019 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2019. Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Our payment of dividends is and will continue to be restricted by or subject to, among other limitations, applicable provisions of federal and state laws, our earnings and various business considerations, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, our future business prospects, our status as a holding company and such other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the senior credit facility and of the indentures governing our Senior Notes restrict our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances as stated above. See Note 10, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our Senior Notes. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2019 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating leases $ 947.0 $ 296.2 $ 357.8 $ 176.8 $ 116.2 Purchase obligations (1) 595.8 595.7 0.1 — — 2019 Senior Notes 350.0 350.0 — — — 2021 Senior Notes 475.0 — 475.0 — — Interest payments on senior notes 99.4 51.3 48.1 — — Total (2) $ 2,467.2 $ 1,293.2 $ 881.0 $ 176.8 $ 116.2 ___________________ (1) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (2) As of February 2, 2019 , we had $17.7 million of income tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability (and the timing of any related payments) cannot be reasonably determined and therefore these liabilities are excluded from the table above. In addition, certain payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. See Note 8, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our uncertain tax positions. We lease retail stores, warehouse facilities, office space and equipment. These are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have been classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require us to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. 31 As of February 2, 2019 , we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $7.2 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $24.1 million , $8.1 million of which are cash collateralized. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 2, 2019 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements, with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories Estimate Description. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value.  A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at February 2, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.6 million in fiscal 2018 . Cash Consideration Received from Vendors Estimate Description. We participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which our vendors provide us with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors’ products. The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs generally cover a period from a few weeks up to a month and include items such as product in-store display promotions and placement, internet advertising, co-op print advertising and other programs. The allowance for each event is negotiated with the vendor and requires specific performance by us to be earned. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a significant portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory rather than as an offset to our marketing and advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. We estimate the amount of vendor allowances to be deferred as a reduction of inventory based on the nature of the consideration received and the merchandise inventory to which the consideration relates. We apply a sell-through rate to determine the timing in which the consideration should be recognized in cost of sales. Consideration received that relates to video game products that have not yet been released to the public is deferred. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Although we consider our advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances.  Additionally, if actual results are not consistent with our estimated deferrals and sell-through rates, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially impact our gross profit rates and inventory balances. A 10% difference in our vendor allowances deferral at February 2, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2018 . 32 Customer Liabilities Estimate Description. Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards and discounts. We allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration. The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated amount of points that will never be redeemed, which is a concept known in the retail industry as "breakage." Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer and recognize estimated breakage on gift cards in proportion to historical redemption patterns, regardless of the age of the unredeemed gift cards. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average retail price per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased through the redemption of loyalty points. We estimate breakage of loyalty points and unredeemed gift cards based on historical redemption rates. A weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is used to estimate the value of our deferred revenue associated with loyalty points. The weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual loyalty point redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption values, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. Potential Impact if Results Differ . We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, retail price per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average retail price per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue balance through current period revenue by an amount estimated to cover the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average retail value per point redeemed at February 2, 2019 , in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3.4 million in fiscal 2018 . A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 2, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $13.9 million in fiscal 2018 . Goodwill Estimate Description. Goodwill results from acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. We are required to evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment are present. Our annual test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter, and interim tests are conducted when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As of February 2, 2019 , our goodwill totaled $363.9 million . See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," to our consolidated financial statements for the allocation of our goodwill balance by reporting unit. In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess. Based on the results of our impairment tests performed in fiscal 2018 , we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $795.6 million , $28.8 million , $66.4 million and $79.9 million for the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe segments, respectively. As of February 2, 2019 , the United States is the only remaining segment with goodwill.  The impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization and lower forecasted cash flows. See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The discounted cash flows analyses utilize a five- to seven-year cash flow projection with a terminal value, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The projected cash flows include numerous assumptions such as, among others, future sales trends, operating margins, store count and capital expenditures, all of which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts. The projected sales trends include estimates related to the growth rate of the digital distribution of new video game software. In addition, we corroborate the aggregate fair value of our reporting units with our market capitalization, which may impact certain assumptions in our discounted cash flows analyses. 33 Potential Impact if Results Differ . Variations in any of the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses may arrive at different estimated fair values that could result in a material impairment charge. Assuming all other factors unchanged, a 10% decrease in the projected net cash flows in our United States segment would result in additional impairment charges of approximately $50 million. Alternatively, assuming all other factors unchanged, an increase of 250 basis points to the discount rates utilized in the test of our United States segment would result in an additional impairment charge of approximately $10 million. Sustained declines in our stock price and related market capitalization could impact key assumptions and the estimated fair values of our reporting units that could result in material goodwill impairment charges. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results, our assumptions or in our stock price. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Estimate Description. Indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded as a result of acquisitions and primarily consist of the Micromania trade name. As this intangible asset is expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely, it is not subject to amortization. We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. We value our trade names using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. As of February 2, 2019 , our indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.8 million . As a result of our fiscal 2018 impairment tests, we recognized an impairment charge of $31.9 million associated with our Micromania trade name. The impairment charge was primarily the result of increases in discount rate assumptions, consistent with those utilized in the valuation of our segments for goodwill impairment testing. See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . In valuing our trade names, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding future cash flow projections to ensure that such projections represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which an assumed marked-based royalty rate is applied. Additionally, management judgment is necessary in selecting an appropriate discount rate which is reflective of the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. Potential Impact if Results Differ . Regarding our Micromania trade name, assuming all other factors unchanged, a 10% decline in sales in each forecast period, including the terminal period, would not result in an additional impairment charge.  Alternatively, assuming all other factors unchanged, an increase of 250 basis points to the discount rate utilized in the test of Micromania trade name would not result in an additional impairment charge either. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results or our assumptions. Income Taxes Estimate Description. We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $17.7 million as of February 2, 2019 . Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Our valuation allowance was $32.9 million as of February 2, 2019 . See Note 8, "Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. Judgment and/or Uncertainty . Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Additionally, several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. 34 Potential Impact if Results Differ . Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We are required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and the re-measurement of deferred taxes as well as to re-assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have since completed our analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provisional estimates were reduced by $22.7 million during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon our analysis of our data and tax positions along with the new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting standards and pronouncements.    

  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps (together, the “foreign currency contracts”) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. For the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 , we recognized a $9.6 million gain in selling, general and administrative expenses related to derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of the foreign currency contracts as of February 2, 2019 was a net liability of $0.2 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of February 2, 2019 would result in a gain of $5.9 million or a loss of $4.8 million in value of the forwards, options and swaps. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. Interest Rate Risk Our Revolver’s per annum interest rate is variable and is based on one of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) the LIBO rate or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. Our Senior Notes' per annum interest rate is fixed. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and we therefore believe that we do not have significant interest rate exposure. 35

   Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 1 Merchandise We categorize our sale of products as follows: • Hardware and Accessories. We offer new and pre-owned video game platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (2017). Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products and memory cards. • Software. We offer new and pre-owned video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content (“DLC”) and full-game downloads in our store and e-commerce properties. • Collectibles .  Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes which are sold through our video game store and e-commerce properties, and ThinkGeek and Zing Pop Culture stores. Trade-In Program We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for cash or in-store credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products, which allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed for resale back to our stores. Store Locations Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the United States segment as of February 1, 2020 : Alabama 59 Kentucky 69 North Dakota 8 Alaska 6 Louisiana 61 Ohio 166 Arizona 72 Maine 10 Oklahoma 46 Arkansas 29 Maryland 77 Oregon 35 California 355 Massachusetts 69 Pennsylvania 168 Colorado 57 Michigan 95 Rhode Island 12 Connecticut 45 Minnesota 43 South Carolina 66 Delaware 15 Mississippi 44 South Dakota 10 Florida 231 Missouri 64 Tennessee 89 Georgia 125 Montana 10 Texas 357 Guam 2 Nebraska 20 Utah 27 Hawaii 14 Nevada 38 Vermont 4 Idaho 16 New Hampshire 23 Virginia 113 Illinois 131 New Jersey 104 Washington 72 Indiana 88 New Mexico 25 West Virginia 29 Iowa 30 New York 193 Wisconsin 54 Kansas 30 North Carolina 129 Wyoming 7 Total Domestic Stores 3,642 2 International Locations.

See 

 Item 7, "Management's Discussion and analysis—Business Strategy," for further information. PowerUp Rewards We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards TM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 42.0 million members as of February 1, 2020 , of which approximately 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 5.0 million paying members. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 22.2 million members as of February 1, 2020 . Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships generally include a subscription to Game Informer magazine and additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores. Game Informer We publish Game Informer , the world’s largest print and digital video game publication featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fifth largest consumer publication in the United States and the largest digital magazine in the United States. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Vendors We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors accounted for approximately 77% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2019 . Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive accounted for 28% , 18% , 6% , 5% and 5% , respectively, of our new product purchases during fiscal 2019 . We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. 3 In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our distribution facilities and inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Competition The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and related specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products and other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores. Market Size Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD"), International Development Group ("IDG") and DFC Intelligence ("DFC"), we estimate that the market for new physical console video game products was approximately $16 billion in 2019 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms.  Additionally, based on estimates compiled by DFC, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was approximately $20 billion in 2019 . Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2019 and 2018 , we generated approximately 34% and 37% , respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Zing Pop Culture,” “Power to the Players TM ” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. Employees We have approximately 14,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 22,000 and 42,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit. 4 Sustainability We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2019 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over 2.5 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 3.0 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 1.4 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past eight years. See the Social Responsibility section of our corporate website (http://news.gamestop.com) for further information on our sustainability efforts. We are not incorporating by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K information or materials contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report, before you make an investment decision with respect to our company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Economic conditions in the U.S. and in certain international markets could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing video game products, when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic and other factors outside of the Company's control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, public health crises, including the recent outbreak of coronavirus (or COVID-19), and civil disturbances. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The video game industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business. The video game industry has historically been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. In addition, the features of new consoles or changes to the existing generations of consoles, including any future restrictions or conditions or the ability to play prior generation video games on such consoles, may adversely affect our pre-owned business. 5 The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (launched in 2013), Microsoft Xbox One (launched in 2013) and the Nintendo Switch (launched in 2017). The Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One are nearing the end of their cycle as Sony and Microsoft have announced that their next generation consoles are expected to launch during the holiday period of 2020. We depend upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors. We depend on manufacturers and publishers to deliver video game hardware, software, and consumer electronics in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. In addition, we depend on these manufacturers and publishers to introduce new and innovative products and software titles to drive industry sales. We have experienced sales declines in the past due to a reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms or software titles could result in reduced sales. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment hardware and software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, have and may continue to lower our sales. The current consoles from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. In addition, Microsoft sells disc-less consoles that are currently available to consumers. Downloading of video game content to the current generation video game systems continues to grow and take an increasing percentage of new video game sales. If consumers' preference for downloading video game content continues to increase or these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers’ ability to access and download the current format of video games and incremental content for their games through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase video games in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of game delivery. As a result, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. The interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. Browser, mobile and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. In order to continue to compete effectively in the video game industry, we need to respond effectively to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers’ preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to keep pace with these changes. International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. Our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters, public health crises, or the imposition of import or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China has resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers in China that are part of our supply chain. We have not experienced shortages in supply as a result of the interruptions, but if the work stoppages were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be resulting supply shortages which could impact our ability to import certain products on schedule and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers may impact our financial results. Our financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors. Our largest vendors are Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, which accounted for 28% , 18% , 6% , 5% and 5% , respectively, of our new product purchases in fiscal 2019 . If our suppliers do not provide us with favorable business terms, we may not be able to offer products to our customers at competitive prices. 6 Our international operations expose us to numerous risks. We have international retail operations in Australia, Canada and Europe. Because release schedules for hardware and software introduction in these markets can sometimes differ from release schedules in the United States, the timing of increases and decreases in foreign sales may differ from the timing of increases and decreases in domestic sales. We are also subject to a number of other factors that may affect our current or future international operations. These include: • economic downturns, specifically in the regions in which we operate; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and sovereign debt crises; • international incidents, including public health crises such as the coronavirus; • natural disasters; • government instability; and • competitors entering our current and potential markets. Our operations in Europe are also subject to risks associated with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("EU"). On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland officially exited the EU ("Brexit") and entered into a transition period to negotiate the final terms of Brexit. The transition period is expected to end on December 31, 2020. The continued uncertainty regarding the transition and impact of the withdrawal may have an adverse impact on European and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions could negatively affect consumer demand for our products, which could unfavorably impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business. An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2019 , we generated approximately 34% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • the timing of new store openings or closings; • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; and • changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. An important element of our business strategy is to de-densify our global store base.  Failure to successfully transfer customers and sales from closed stores to nearby stores could adversely impact our financial results. As a part of our business strategy, we are de-densifying our global store base, which includes closing stores that are not meeting performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms with the intent of transferring sales to other nearby locations. We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. 7 If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue may be adversely affected. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion. Pressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which could decrease our profitability. The retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Wal-Mart and Target; computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy; internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com; other U.S. and international video game and PC software specialty stores located in malls and other locations, such as Carrefour and Media Markt; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and may have greater financial resources than we do or other advantages. In addition, video game products and content are increasingly being digitally distributed and new competitors built to take advantage of these new capabilities are entering the marketplace, and other methods may emerge in the future. We also compete with other sellers of pre-owned video game products and other PC software distribution companies, including Steam. Certain of our mass-merchant competitors are expanding in the market for new and pre-owned video games through aggressive pricing which may negatively affect our margins, sales and earnings for these products.  Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including browser, social and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, we may be less profitable. Changes to tariff and import/export regulations may negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. The United States and other countries have from time to time proposed and enacted protectionist trade policies that could increase the cost or reduce the availability of certain merchandise. In particular, the current U.S. administration has made certain changes to import/export tariffs and international trade agreements. The changes announced and made to date do not impact the merchandise that we offer. Any measures that could impact the cost or availability of the merchandise we offer could have an adverse impact on our business because a significant portion of the products we offer are purchased from foreign vendors and manufactured in foreign countries. Failure to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key executives, management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. In addition, the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or our failure to retain key executive officers and other employees in the future may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our distribution centers, as well as to communicate distribution information to the off-site, third-party operated distribution centers with which we work. The third-party distribution centers pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles and deliver them to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores at least twice a week, to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform their functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted or if these centers were unable to accommodate stores in a particular region, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. 8 We rely on centralized facilities for refurbishment of our pre-owned products. Any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on centralized facilities for the refurbishment of many of the pre-owned products that we sell. If any disruption occurred at these facilities, whether due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, systems failures, or other unforeseen causes, sales of our pre-owned products could decrease. Since we generally obtain higher margins on our pre-owned products, any adverse effect on their sales could adversely affect our profitability. Our sales of collectibles depend on popularity of and trends in pop culture, and our ability to react to them. Our sales of collectibles are heavily dependent upon the continued demand by our customers for collectibles, apparel, toys, gadgets, electronics and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts. The popularity of such products is often driven by movies, television shows, music, fashion and other pop culture influences. The market for, and appeal of, particular types of music, movies, television shows, artists, actors, styles, trends and brands are constantly changing. Our failure to anticipate, identify and react appropriately to changing trends and preferences of customers could lead to, among other things, excess inventories and higher markdowns. There can be no assurance that the collectibles and related products that we sell will appeal to our customers. We depend on licensed products for a substantial portion of our sales of collectibles and our inability to maintain such licenses and obtain new licensed products would adversely affect our sales of collectibles. We license from others the rights to sell certain of our collectibles and many of these products contain a third party’s trademarks, designs and other intellectual property. If we are unable to maintain current licenses or obtain new licensed products with comparable consumer demand, our sales of collectibles would decline. Furthermore, we may not be able to prevent a licensor from choosing not to renew a license with us and/or from licensing a product to one of our competitors. If we do not maintain the security of our customer, employee or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. An important part of our business involves the receipt, processing and storage of personal information of our customers and employees, including, in the case of customers, payment information. We have systems and processes in place that are designed to protect against security and data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information.  Nevertheless, cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Techniques or software used to gain unauthorized access, and/or disable, degrade or harm our systems may be difficult to detect for prolonged periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or put in place protective or preventive measures. These attempts to gain unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. If individuals are successful in infiltrating, breaking into, disrupting, damaging or otherwise stealing from the computer systems of the Company or its third-party providers, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, including interruptions in our ability to accept payment from customers and our ability to issue and redeem loyalty points under our Power Up Rewards program. Such an event may also expose us to costly litigation, government investigations, government enforcement actions, fines and/or lawsuits and may significantly harm our reputation with our members and customers. We are continuously working to upgrade our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to protect our member, customer, employee, and company data against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against future data security breaches. While past cybersecurity attacks have not resulted in material losses, a data security breach or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could materially impact our business and our results of operations.  Moreover, a data security breach or change in applicable privacy or security laws or regulations could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the breach or such change in laws or regulations and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard against such breaches or to comply with such change in laws or regulations, which could disrupt our business, operations and financial condition. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers. Our continued success depends upon customers' perception of our Company. Any negative publicity relating to our vendors, products, practices or our Company could damage our reputation. The increased use of social media platforms allows for the rapid dispersal of information, including negative feedback or other commentary, which could negatively impact our reputation and result in declines in customer loyalty and adversely affect our results of operations. 9 If our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, our business may be adversely affected and we may lose market confidence in our reported financial information which could adversely impact our business and stock price. Effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. As disclosed in Part II,

Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is the world's largest video game retailer, operates approximately 5,500 stores across 14 countries, and offers the best selection of new and pre-owned video gaming consoles, accessories and video game titles, in both physical and digital formats. GameStop also offers fans a wide variety of POP! vinyl figures, collectibles board games and more. Through GameStop's unique buy-sell-trade program, gamers can trade in video game consoles, games, and accessories, as well as consumer electronics for cash or in-store credit. Our consumer product network also includes www.gamestop.com and Game Informer magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication. Our corporate office is located in Grapevine, Texas. We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2019 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 1, 2020 ("fiscal 2019 "). Fiscal year 2018 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 2, 2019 ("fiscal 2018 ") and fiscal year 2017 consisted of the 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2018 ("fiscal 2017 "). The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. The near-term global economic conditions have been adversely impacted by the emergence of a novel coronavirus in China, identified as COVID-19, which continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to mitigate the continued spread of the virus, governments have imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and similar measures. We have temporarily closed stores on a country-wide basis in Europe, primarily in Italy and France, as well as in Canada, which became effective in various points in March 2020. In the United States, effective March 22, 2020, we have temporarily closed all storefronts to customers but continue to process orders on a digital only basis, offering curbside pick-up at stores and e-commerce delivery only. As a result of these actions and restrictions, we expect a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand. Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. Gaming consoles have historically launched in five to seven-year cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in the gaming experience and add other entertainment capabilities. Consumer demand for gaming consoles are typically the highest in the early years of the cycle and the weakest in the latter years. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (launched in 2013), Microsoft Xbox One (launched in 2013) and the Nintendo Switch (launched in 2017). The Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One are nearing the end of their cycle as Sony and Microsoft have announced that their next generation consoles are expected to launch during the holiday period of 2020. The sale of video games delivered through digital channels and other forms of gaming continue to grow and take an increasing percentage of physical video game sales. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), full-game downloads, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We have made significant investments in e-commerce and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to access digital content to facilitate the digital sales and delivery process. We plan to continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category. In our discussion of the results of operations, we refer to comparable store sales, which is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth or decline in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our video game stores, including stand-alone collectible stores, operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales compares the fiscal year ended to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer that provides its consumers several ways to access its products. 17 BUSINESS STRATEGY In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot, to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following four tenets. Optimize the core business. Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Become the social / cultural hub for gaming. Create the social and cultural hub of gaming across the GameStop platform and offerings. Build a frictionless digital ecosystem. Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch of GameStop.com, to reach customers more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, anytime, anywhere. Transform vendor partnerships. Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams and optimize the lifetime value of every customer. Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and expect to incur future costs including, but not limited to, consulting fees, severance and store closure costs. See "Consolidated Results from Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses" for further information. We remain committed to a capital allocation strategy focused on optimizing long-term value creation. With this approach, we will return capital to shareholders when the time is right and balance that opportunity against the need to maintain a strong balance sheet and to invest in responsible growth that will drive innovation for the business. During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 38.1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $198.7 million under our authorized repurchase program. STORE COUNT INFORMATION The following table presents the number of stores by segment that were opened and disposed of during fiscal 2019 : February 2, 2019 Opened Disposed February 1, 2020 United States 3,846 6 (210 ) 3,642 Canada 311 — (12 ) 299 Australia 462 2 (38 ) 426 Europe 1,211 4 (73 ) 1,142 Total Stores 5,830 12 (333 ) 5,509 SEASONALITY Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. 18 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain statement of operations items (in millions) and as a percentage of net sales, for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year 2019 Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales Net sales $ 6,466.0 100.0 % $ 8,285.3 100.0 % $ 8,547.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 4,557.3 70.5 5,977.2 72.1 6,062.2 70.9 Gross profit 1,908.7 29.5 2,308.1 27.9 2,484.9 29.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,922.7 29.8 1,994.2 24.2 2,031.9 23.8 Goodwill impairments 363.9 5.6 970.7 11.7 — — Asset impairments 21.7 0.3 45.2 0.5 13.8 0.2 Operating (loss) earnings (399.6 ) (6.2 ) (702.0 ) (8.5 ) 439.2 5.1 Interest expense, net 27.2 0.4 51.1 0.6 55.3 0.6 (Loss) earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (426.8 ) (6.6 ) (753.1 ) (9.1 ) 383.9 4.5 Income tax expense 37.6 0.6 41.7 0.5 153.5 1.8 Net (loss) income from continuing operations (464.4 ) (7.2 ) (794.8 ) (9.6 ) 230.4 2.7 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (6.5 ) (0.1 ) 121.8 1.5 (195.7 ) (2.3 ) Net (loss) income $ (470.9 ) (7.3 )% $ (673.0 ) (8.1 )% $ 34.7 0.4 % The following table sets forth net sales by significant product category for the period indicated (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2019 Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Hardware and accessories $ 2,722.2 42.1 % $ 3,717.8 44.9 % $ 3,651.0 42.7 % Software 3,006.3 46.5 3,856.5 46.5 4,257.4 49.8 Collectibles 737.5 11.4 711.0 8.6 638.7 7.5 Total $ 6,466.0 100.0 % $ 8,285.3 100.0 % $ 8,547.1 100.0 % Net sales by reportable segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year 2019 Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Comparable Store Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Comparable Store Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Comparable Store Sales United States $ 4,497.7 69.6 % (20.9 )% 5,800.2 70.0 % 1.8 % 5,876.0 68.7 % 4.3 % Canada 344.2 5.3 (18.9 ) 434.5 5.2 3.1 434.9 5.1 10.0 Australia 525.4 8.1 (12.0 ) 645.4 7.8 (3.4 ) 702.2 8.2 8.2 Europe 1,098.7 17.0 (16.8 ) 1,405.2 17.0 (7.7 ) 1,534.0 18.0 9.5 Total $ 6,466.0 100.0 % (19.4 )% $ 8,285.3 100.0 % (0.3 )% 8,547.1 100.0 % 5.8 % 19 Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018 Net Sales Net sales decreased $1,819.3 million , or 22.0% , in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 . The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales of 19.4% and the impact of 321 net global store closures. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by lower demand for the current generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft as they near the end of their console cycle, a decline in software sales as well as a decline of audio-related and other accessories related to the growth in battle-royale gaming in fiscal 2018. The decrease in sales of software was primarily due to a reduction in the number and success of title releases compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of Nintendo Switch products and collectibles. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in our United States, Canada, Australia and Europe segments declined by 22.5%, 20.8%, 18.6% and 21.8%, respectively, when compared to fiscal 2018. Comparable store sales in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe decreased by 20.9% , 18.9% , 12.0% and 16.8% , respectively, primarily due to the same factors described above. In addition, Australia and Europe were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $32.7 million and $52.8 million, respectively. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $399.4 million , or 17.3% , in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% in fiscal 2019 compared to 27.9% in fiscal 2018 . The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher margin products, driven by the decline in lower margin video game hardware sales, as well as lower promotional activity in the fiscal 2019 holiday season compared to the fiscal 2018 holiday season. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased $71.5 million , or 3.6% , in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by approximately $79.0 million in cost reduction efforts and variable expenses due to lower sales, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $30.6 million and the impact of store closures of approximately $20.0 million, which were partially offset by costs associated with our transformation initiatives and severance totaling $60.7 million. Goodwill and Asset Impairments Goodwill and asset impairments decreased $630.3 million, or 62.0% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $363.9 million and $970.7 million , respectively. See Note 7 , “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We have no remaining goodwill balances as of February 1, 2020. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased by $23.9 million, or 46.8%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , primarily due to the redemption of our $350.0 million unsecured senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Income Tax Income tax expense was $37.6 million , representing a negative effective tax rate of 8.8% in fiscal 2019 , compared to $41.7 million in fiscal 2018 , representing a negative effective tax rate of 5.5% . The negative effective tax rate of 8.8% in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of a permanent difference for non-deductible impairment charges and valuation allowances recognized in the year. The negative effective tax rate of 5.5% in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of non-deductible impairment charges and the settlement of the tax dispute in France. See Note 8, "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax On January 16, 2019, we completed the sale of all of the equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary Spring Communications Holding, Inc. ("Spring Mobile") to Prime Acquisition Company, LLC ("Prime"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prime Communications, L.P., pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of November 21, 2018. The net cash proceeds received from the sale at closing totaled $727.9 million . We recognized a gain on sale in fiscal 2018 of $100.8 million ( $65.4 million , net of tax). During fiscal 2019, we were unable to settle on proposed working capital adjustments with Prime and, as a result, the proposed adjustments were submitted to arbitration proceedings under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized a charge of $5.5 million million related to the final working capital adjustments settled through arbitration proceedings. We have no significant contingencies or continuing involvement with Spring Mobile. 20 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $6.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $121.8 million in fiscal 2018. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale, net of tax, of $65.4 million . Refer to Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Dispositions," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net Sales Net sales decreased $261.8 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to fiscal 2017 including 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2018, the impact of 117 store closures (net of openings), the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a decrease in comparable stores sales of 0.3%. Sales for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 were approximately $132.7 million. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a decrease in software sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and hardware and accessories. The decrease in sales of software was primarily due to weaker new title releases in the first half of fiscal 2018 and weakening demand as a result of increasing digital adoption, partially offset by an increase in sales of Nintendo Switch titles due to the expansion of the hardware install base and increase of new release titles. The increase in sales of collectibles was primarily driven by new and improved product offerings. The increase in sales of hardware and accessories was primarily driven by growth in sales of audio-related and other accessories associated with the battle-royale gaming genre. Net sales for fiscal 2018 in the United States, Australia and Europe declined by 1.3%, 8.1% and 8.4%, respectively, when compared to fiscal 2017.  Net sales in Canada were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Net sales in the United States were negatively affected by the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $91.1 million and the impact of 66 stores closures (net of openings), which were partially offset by a comparable store sales increase of 1.8%. Comparable store sales in Canada increased by 3.1%, which was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $9.2 million and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $6.4 million. The decline in net sales in Australia was primarily the result of the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $30.6 million, the decrease in comparable store sales of 3.4% and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $10.1 million. The decline in net sales in Europe was primarily due to the 7.7% decrease in comparable store sales and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017 of approximately $25.1 million, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $13.6 million. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased $176.8 million, or 7.1%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to 29.1% in fiscal 2017. Gross profit for the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2017 was approximately $34.7 million. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by a shift in product mix to lower margin hardware products, primarily driven by the decline in software sales, and higher software promotional activity in the fiscal 2018 holiday season. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased $37.7 million, or 1.9%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017, a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to declining capital expenditures over the past several years, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Goodwill and Asset Impairments During fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $970.7 million and asset impairment charges totaling $45.2 million. The impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization and lower forecasted cash flows. During fiscal 2017, we recognized asset impairment charges of $13.8 million, which was primarily comprised of an $11.0 million impairment of our Simply Mac dealer agreement intangible asset. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during fiscal 2017. See Note 7, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Income Tax Income tax expense was $41.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of (5.5)% in fiscal 2018, compared to $153.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 40.0% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective income tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily driven by non-deductible impairment charges, the settlement of the tax dispute in France, tax reform, revisions to transition taxes and the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions within which we operate. See Note 8, "Income Taxes," and Note 12, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. 21 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax On January 16, 2019, we completed the previously announced sale of all of the equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary Spring Communications Holding, Inc. ("Spring Mobile") to Prime Acquisition Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prime Communications, L.P., pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of November 21, 2018. The net cash proceeds received from the sale totaled $727.9 million, which is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain on sale of $100.8 million ($65.4 million, net of tax) during fiscal 2018. The historical results of Spring Mobile, including the gain on sale, is reported as discontinued operations. Except for customary post-closing adjustments and transition services, we have no contingencies or continuing involvement with Spring Mobile subsequent to the completion of the sale. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $121.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $195.7 million in fiscal 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale, net of tax, of $65.4 million. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2017 includes goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $377.0 million. Refer to Note 2, "Discontinued Operations and Dispositions," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. As of February 1, 2020 , we had total cash on hand of $499.4 million and an additional $270.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our $420 million revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as of February 1, 2020 . Our cash on hand attributable to foreign operations totaled $207.9 million as of February 1, 2020 .  Although we may, from time to time, evaluate strategies and alternatives with respect to the cash attributable to our foreign operations, we currently anticipate that this cash will remain in those foreign jurisdictions and it therefore may not be available for immediate use in the United States. As of February 1, 2020, based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our revolving credit facility together will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations. In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we have temporarily closed stores on a country-wide basis in Europe, primarily in Italy and France, as well as in Canada, which became effective in various points in March 2020. In the United States, effective March 22, 2020, we have temporarily closed all storefronts to customers but continue to process orders on a digital only basis, offering curbside pick-up at stores and e-commerce delivery only. As a result of these actions, we expect a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand, which will adversely impact our ability to generate cash from our operating activities. We cannot reasonably estimate the amount of this negative impact. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, repurchasing shares of our common stock or our outstanding debt obligations, as well as other transactions that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The amount, nature and timing of any strategic operational changes, or purchases of our debt or equity securities will depend on our available cash and liquidity, operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. As part of our previously announced GameStop Reboot profit improvement initiative, we are evaluating future strategic and operating alternatives for certain of our unprofitable operating subsidiaries and business units that operate within our international segments. In total, we currently believe that any potential charges associated with the disposition or wind-down of certain operations under consideration, primarily relating to lease and severance obligations and accelerated depreciation and amortization, would not be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Cash Flows During fiscal 2019 , cash used in operations was $414.5 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $325.1 million in fiscal 2018 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $739.6 million was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and lower earnings in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2018 , cash provided by operations was $325.1 million , compared to cash provided by operations of $434.9 million in fiscal 2017 . The decrease in cash provided by operations of $109.8 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, in fiscal 2018 compared to prior year. Cash used in investing activities was $60.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $635.5 million in fiscal 2018 and cash used in fiscal 2017 of $60.6 million . The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2018 included $727.9 million in proceeds from the sale of Spring Mobile. The cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 included $58.5 million in proceeds from divestitures, primarily from the sale of Kongregate. Capital expenditures totaled $78.5 million , $93.7 million and $113.4 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. 22 In fiscal 2019 , our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $644.7 million consisting primarily of the redemption of our $350.0 million 2019 senior notes in April 2019, repurchases of our common stock totaling $198.7 million , open market repurchases of our 2021 Senior Notes totaling $53.6 million and dividends paid on our common stock of $40.5 million . In fiscal 2018, our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $174.7 million consisting primarily of dividends paid of $157.4 million and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $12.2 million. The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of dividends paid of $155.2 million, the settlement of share repurchases of $22.0 million that were initiated in fiscal 2016 and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $21.8 million. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022. The Revolver has a $200 million expansion feature and $50 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans range from 0.25% to 0.50% and, for London Interbank Offered ("LIBO") rate loans, range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of February 1, 2020 , the applicable margin was 0.25% for prime rate loans and 1.25% for LIBO rate loans. As of February 1, 2020 , total availability under the Revolver was $270.3 million , with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.3 million . During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed $150 million on our Revolver. In March 2016, we issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. The agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our 2021 Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the indentures governing our Revolver and 2021 Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and our Revolver. See Note 10 , “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Revolver and 2021 Senior Notes. Our Luxembourg subsidiary maintains a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the “Line of Credit”) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of February 1, 2020 , there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $9.0 million . Share Repurchases On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization allowing our management to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our Class A Common Stock with no expiration date. On June 11, 2019, we commenced a modified Dutch auction tender offer for up to 12.0 million shares of our Class A common stock with a price range between $5.20 and $6.00 per share. The tender offer expired on July 10, 2019. Through the tender offer, we accepted for payment 12.0 million shares at a purchase price of $5.20 per share for a total of $62.9 million, including fees and commissions. The shares purchased through the tender offer were immediately retired. In addition to the equity tender offer described above, during the second half of fiscal 2019, we executed a series of open market repurchases for an aggregate of 26.1 million shares of our Class A common stock totaling $135.8 million , including fees and commissions. These repurchased shares were immediately retired. In aggregate, during fiscal 2019, we repurchased a total of 38.1 million shares of our Class A common stock, totaling $198.7 million , for an average price of $5.19 per share. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017. As of February 1, 2020 , we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. 23 Dividends We paid cash dividends of $40.5 million , $157.4 million and $155.2 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . On June 3, 2019, our Board of Directors elected to eliminate the Company’s quarterly dividend, effective immediately, in an effort to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and provide increased financial flexibility. We believe the decision to eliminate the dividend will enable us to further reduce debt and provide us flexibility as we seek to drive value creation for stockholders. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of February 1, 2020 (in millions): Payments Due by Fiscal Period Total FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Thereafter Operating leases $ 846.2 $ 268.5 $ 184.8 $ 129.8 $ 93.0 $ 65.7 $ 104.4 Purchase obligations (1) 463.5 463.5 — — — — — 2021 Senior Notes 421.4 — 421.4 — — — — Interest payments on senior notes 42.6 28.4 14.2 — — — — Total (2) $ 1,773.7 $ 760.4 $ 620.4 $ 129.8 $ 93.0 $ 65.7 $ 104.4 ___________________ (1) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (2) As of February 1, 2020 , we had $9.2 million of income tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability (and the timing of any related payments) cannot be reasonably determined and therefore these liabilities are excluded from the table above. In addition, certain payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. See Note 8 , "Income Taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our uncertain tax positions. We lease retail stores, warehouse facilities, office space and equipment. These are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which have been classified as operating leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases, percentage rentals and require us to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. As of February 1, 2020 , we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $7.3 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $24.6 million , of which $7.6 million is cash collateralized. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 1, 2020 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 , "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements, with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. 24 Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value. A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at February 1, 2020 would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.3 million in fiscal 2019 . Customer Liabilities Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards and discounts. We allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration. The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated amount of points that will never be redeemed, which is a concept known in the retail industry as "breakage." Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer and recognize estimated breakage on gift cards in proportion to historical redemption patterns, regardless of the age of the unredeemed gift cards. The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average retail price per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased through the redemption of loyalty points. We estimate breakage of loyalty points and unredeemed gift cards based on historical redemption rates. A weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is used to estimate the value of our deferred revenue associated with loyalty points. The weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual loyalty point redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption values, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, retail price per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average retail price per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue balance through current period revenue by an amount estimated to cover the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average retail value per point redeemed at February 1, 2020 , in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.1 million in fiscal 2019 . A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February 1, 2020 would have affected net earnings by approximately $11.3 million in fiscal 2019 . Goodwill Goodwill results from acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. We are required to evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment are present. During fiscal 2019, we recognized an impairment charge for our remaining goodwill in the amount of $363.9 million , all of which related to our United States segment. As of February 1, 2020 , we had no remaining goodwill. See Note 7 , "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess. In fiscal 2019, we estimated the fair value of our United States segment by using a combination of the income approach and market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows, which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts, and requires significant assumptions including, among others, a discount rate and a terminal value. The market approach is based on the observed ratios of enterprise value to earnings of the Company and other comparable, publicly-traded companies. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The discounted cash flows analyses utilize a five- to seven-year cash flow projection with a terminal value, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The projected cash flows include numerous assumptions such as, among others, future sales trends, operating margins, store count and capital expenditures, all of which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts. The projected sales trends include estimates related to the growth rate of the digital distribution of new video game software. In addition, we corroborate the aggregate fair value of our reporting units with our market capitalization, which may impact certain assumptions in our discounted cash flows analyses. 25 Income Taxes We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $9.2 million as of February 1, 2020 . Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized.  We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets.  Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies.  We have therefore established valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company has determined existing deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowance increased to $112.7 million as of February 1, 2020 . See Note 8 , "Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. We continue to evaluate the realizability of all deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis as it relates to expected future earnings.  Should the Company fail to achieve its expected earnings in the coming periods, it may be necessary to establish an additional valuation allowance against some or all of its deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions not currently subject to a valuation allowance. Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Additionally, several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting standards and pronouncements.    

  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. The forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans. We recognized a gain of $4.1 million and $9.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to derivative instruments for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 , respectively. The aggregate fair value of the forward exchange contracts as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 was a net asset of $1.1 million and a net liability of $0.2 million , respectively, as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of February 1, 2020 would result in a gain of $10.2 million or a loss of $8.4 million in value of the forwards, options and swaps. 26 We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. Interest Rate Risk The per annum interest rate on our $420 million revolving credit facility is variable and is based on one of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) LIBOR or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. We had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 . In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulatory body of LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has proposed the replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Whether or not SOFR is generally accepted as the LIBOR replacement remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. Our revolving credit facility matures in November 2022, therefore, we anticipate that we will amend our revolving credit facility prior to the LIBOR quotation termination date. There can be no assurances as to what alternative reference rates may be and whether such rates will be more or less favorable than LIBOR and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. Our Senior Notes' per annum interest rate is fixed. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and we therefore believe that we do not have significant interest rate exposure.

Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes which are sold through our video game stores and e-commerce properties, and ThinkGeek ® and Zing Pop Culture ® stores. Trade-In Program We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for cash or in-store credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at new title releases and console launches. We resell these pre-owned video game products, which allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for resale back to our stores and e-commerce properties. Store Locations Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 30, 2021, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,816 stores worldwide. Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the United States segment as of January 30, 2021: Alabama 52 Kentucky 64 North Dakota 7 Alaska 6 Louisiana 59 Ohio 145 Arizona 65 Maine 7 Oklahoma 42 Arkansas 28 Maryland 59 Oregon 33 California 287 Massachusetts 58 Pennsylvania 136 Colorado 52 Michigan 86 Rhode Island 10 Connecticut 33 Minnesota 40 South Carolina 63 Delaware 14 Mississippi 40 South Dakota 7 Florida 202 Missouri 59 Tennessee 85 Georgia 112 Montana 10 Texas 326 Guam 2 Nebraska 19 Utah 25 Hawaii 13 Nevada 35 Vermont 4 Idaho 16 New Hampshire 20 Virginia 100 Illinois 111 New Jersey 87 Washington 65 Indiana 80 New Mexico 22 West Virginia 25 Iowa 26 New York 151 Wisconsin 48 Kansas 29 North Carolina 121 Wyoming 6 Total Domestic Stores 3,192 2 International Locations.

Our strategic plan is designed to stabilize and optimize our core business while at the same time pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.  See Part II, 

 Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Strategy.” We utilize cash generated from operations, cash on hand and funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to fund our operations and in 2019 and 2020, Reboot transformation initiatives.  We may also fund our operations and potential costs related to the acceleration of future transformation initiatives, such as product catalogue expansion efforts, as circumstances warrant, from other sources of capital, including sales of our equity and debt securities.  In December 2020, we established an "at-the-market" offering program (the "ATM Program") that provides for the sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million, from time to time, through Jeffries LLC, as the sales agent under the ATM Program. See Part II,   

 Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Through the date of this Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program.  Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs.  The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock. PowerUp Rewards We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards ® ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 47.1 million members as of January 30, 2021, of which approximately 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop ® in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 4.4 million paying members. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 22.8 million members as of January 30, 2021. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships generally include a subscription to Game Informer ® magazine and additional discounts and benefits in our stores and e-commerce properties. Game Informer ® We publish Game Informer ® , the world’s leading video game publication featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the magazine are sold through 3 subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer ® is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer ® are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer ® operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Vendors We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors accounted for approximately 79% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2020. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, U&I Entertainment and Ubisoft Entertainment accounted for 31%, 22%, 9%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our new product purchases during fiscal 2020. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection for our customers to purchase what they want and how and when they want it. We use our distribution facilities, store locations, and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. In 2020, we introduced same day delivery service in certain markets to enhance the customer shopping and delivery experience.  See   

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2020. 29 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. We may also fund our growth capital needs, as circumstances warrant, from sales of equity and debt securities. As of January 30, 2021, we had total unrestricted cash on hand of $508.5 million, $126.5 million of restricted cash and an additional $88.4 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. On March 15, 2021, we repaid our outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the Revolver (as defined below). See Note 19 “Subsequent Events”. Availability under our revolving credit facilities, which was increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as described in the Sources of Liquidity section below, provides us additional liquidity throughout the course of the year to fund our operations. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future. While factors related to COVID-19 have negatively impacted our results during fiscal 2020, those negative impacts were generally offset by the positive results generated from our working capital initiatives, primarily inventory management and our expense reduction initiatives which supports an improved liquidity position. We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and future transformation initiatives. Key areas of future investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer-facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; focusing on enhancing and optimizing the customer service proposition; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce teams and capabilities; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our delivery times and shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our retail platform. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. On July 6, 2020 we issued $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes. See Note 12, "Debt," for further details on this debt exchange. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance; our commitments and obligations; our capital requirements; limitations imposed under our credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world, many of our vendors have been impacted by the volatility in the supply chain financing market. As we seek to optimize our inventories, including for next generation video game consoles and a number of new software releases, and related payment terms, we have increased the amount of credit support collateral we provide to select vendors for our inventory purchase obligations. Our continued provision of collateral, and the levels of such collateral, will depend on a variety of factors, including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral. See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Restricted Cash" for further details. Cash Flows In fiscal 2020, cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of $123.7 million, an increase of $538.2 million compared to an outflow of $414.5 million during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to improvements in working capital as a result of optimizing inventory and accounts payable levels through optimizing the cash conversion cycle and more efficient carrying levels of inventory. In fiscal 2019, cash provided by operations was an outflow of $414.5 million, compared to an inflow of $325.1 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operations of $739.6 million from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments and lower earnings in fiscal 2019 compared to prior year. In fiscal 2020, cash from investing activities was an inflow of $36.9 million compared to an outflow of $60.9 million in fiscal 2019 and a cash inflow of $635.5 million in fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2020 cash inflow from investing activities was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sale and leaseback of five properties including our headquarter facilities in the United States, Australia and Canada as well as a refurbishment center and ancillary office space in Grapevine, Texas, lower capital expenditures in the current year period and $8.6 million net proceeds from the sale of our corporate aircraft. See Note 1, "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 11, "Leases" for further information. 30 In fiscal 2018, cash provided by investing activities included $727.9 million in proceeds from divestitures, primarily from the sale of Spring Mobile. Capital expenditures totaled $60.0 million, $78.5 million and $93.7 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2020, our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $55.4 million consisting primarily of the repayment of $130.3 million of our 2021 Senior Notes through a combination of open market transactions and an optional early redemption of $125.0 million of our 2021 Senior Notes, at par, in December 2020, partially offset by a net $25.0 million draw down on our Revolver and $47.1 million in proceeds from term loans entered into by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS. In 2019, our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $644.7 million consisting primarily of the redemption of our $350.0 million 2019 senior notes in April 2019, repurchases of our Class A Common Stock totaling $198.7 million, open market repurchases of our 2021 Senior Notes totaling $53.6 million and dividends paid on our Class A Common Stock of $40.5 million. In fiscal 2018, our financing activities were a net cash outflow of $174.7 million consisting primarily of dividends paid of $157.4 million and repayment of acquisition-related debt of $12.2 million. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022. The Revolver also includes a $200 million expansion feature and $100 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans range from 0.25% to 0.50% and, for the London Interbank Offered ("LIBO") rate loans, range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of the assets of GameStop Corp. and the assets of its domestic subsidiaries, such lien being junior to the lien in certain of such assets that secure the 2023 Senior Notes. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of January 30, 2021, the applicable margin was 0.50% for prime rate loans and 1.50% for LIBO rate loans. As of January 30, 2021, total availability under the Revolver after giving effect to the Availability Reduction (as defined below) was $88.4 million, with outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million and outstanding standby letters of credit of $9.8 million. On March 15, 2021, we repaid our outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the Revolver. See Note 19 “Subsequent Events”. In August 2020, we entered into the fourth amendment (“Fourth Amendment”) to the credit agreement governing our Revolver (“Credit Agreement”) giving effect to certain amendments, which are incorporated above and include, but are not limited to the following: • Reduced the amount of the excess availability trigger that determines whether the Company is subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.0:1.0 from the greater of $30 million and 10% of the borrowing base to the greater of $12.5 million and 10% of the borrowing base; • Increased the sublimit for issuances of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement from $50 million to $100 million; and • Increased the amount of letters of credit permitted to be issued separately from, and not pursuant to, the Credit Agreement from $25 million to (i) up to $150 million for letters of credit issued by borrowers/guarantors under the Credit Agreement and (ii) up to $75 million for letters of credit issued for the benefit of foreign subsidiaries, subject to the understanding that the outstanding amount of letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, combined with the outstanding amount of letters of credit otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement cannot exceed $275 million in the aggregate. The agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds (the "Availability Reduction"). We are currently in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes and the agreement governing our Revolver. As of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding of our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes were $73.2 million and $216.4 million, respectively. Additionally, as of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal balance outstanding under term loans entered into by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, was €40.0 million ($48.6 million as of January 30, 2021). 31 On March 15, 2021, we redeemed the remaining $73.2 million principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes. See Note 19 “Subsequent events” Our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, also maintained a credit facility of €20.0 million ($24.3 million as of January 30, 2021) that allows it to obtain short term loans of 10 to 93 days in duration to support its working capital needs. The credit facility commitments expired in January 2021. No amounts were drawn under this facility through January 30, 2021. Separately from the asset-based Revolver, we maintain uncommitted letter of credit facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of January 30, 2021, we had $133.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and other bank guarantees under facilities outside of the Revolver. See Note 12, "Debt," for additional information. We may also fund our growth capital needs, as circumstances warrant, from sales of equity and debt securities. The timing and amount of any equity sales would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our common equity. In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an "at the market offering" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock. We are under no obligation to offer and sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program.  As of January 30, 2021, and through the date of this Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program. Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives. The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock. Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding our ongoing digital-first growth strategy and product category expansion efforts. For additional information, see   

  ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. The forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans. We recognized a loss of $6.1 million and a gain of $4.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to derivative instruments for the fiscal years ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. The aggregate fair value of the forward exchange contracts as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 was a net asset of $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from 35 the market rate as of January 30, 2021 would result in a gain of $11.2 million or a loss of $9.2 million in value of the forwards, options and swaps. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. Interest Rate Risk The per annum interest rate on our $420 million revolving credit facility is variable and is based on (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) LIBOR or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. We had $25.0 million and no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. On March 15, 2021, we repaid our outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the Revolver. See Note 19 “Subsequent Events”. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulatory body of LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has proposed the replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Whether or not SOFR is generally accepted as the LIBOR replacement remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. Our revolving credit facility matures in November 2022, therefore, we anticipate that we will amend our revolving credit facility prior to the LIBOR quotation termination date. There can be no assurances as to what alternative reference rates may be and whether such rates will be more or less favorable than LIBOR and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. Our Senior Notes' per annum interest rate is fixed. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and we therefore believe that we do not have significant interest rate exposure.

The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X, and the Nintendo Switch. Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products and memory cards. 1 • Software. We offer new and pre-owned gaming software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content (“DLC”) and full-game downloads. • Collectibles . Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the gaming, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes. Trade-In Program We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned gaming, mobility and other products at our stores in exchange for cash or in-store credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. This process drives higher market share and offers a broader range of price points for our customers. Our trade-in program provides customers a means to unlock value and recycle used product, which enables us to offer previous generation platforms and related games. We operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where used gaming, mobility, and other products can be tested, repaired, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for sale. Store Locations Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 29, 2022, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,573 stores worldwide. Domestic Locations.

Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business while at the same time, pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries. GameStop is focused on transforming into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers and is actively focused on the below: • Establish ecommerce excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment across all channels and will scale up our ecommerce operations to make the most convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, improvements in fulfillment and delivery times, better product availability across all channels, and a further improved customer service experience. • Expand our selection to deliver a market-leading offering in gaming & entertainment. Continue investing in expanding our product offering to relevant categories for our customers, including becoming a leader in PC gaming, virtual reality, and other gaming products. • Leverage existing strengths and assets. Grow our presence in the gaming community and increase market share through enhancing the value of our loyalty program and Game Informer assets while also expanding the scope of our buy, sell, and trade business to support our expanded offering. • Invest in new growth opportunities. As we scale and expand our core offerings we will simultaneously invest in additional growth, including blockchain, digital assets (including non-fungible tokens ("NFTs")), Web 3.0 technology, and new destination formats for our stores. In January 2022, we entered into partnerships with Immutable X Pty Limited (“IMX”) and Digital Worlds NFTs Ltd. ("Digital Worlds") pursuant to which IMX will become a technology partner and platform for our NFT marketplace, and Digital Worlds will grant up to $100 million in IMX tokens to creators of NFT content and technology. In addition, Digital Worlds agreed to provide up to approximately $150 million in IMX tokens to GameStop upon the achievement of certain milestones. We believe these future transformation efforts are an important aspect of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. In fiscal 2021 we further strengthened our balance sheet by eliminating $314.6 million of total outstanding debt as of fiscal 2020 and raising $1,672.8 million in gross equity capital through an at-the-market offering. Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See "Consolidated Results of Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses" for additional information. 3 PowerUp Rewards Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards ® ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 50.5 million members as of January 29, 2022, of which approximately 16.1 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop ® in the past year.

Vendors We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Our largest vendors are Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, U&I Entertainment and Electronic Arts, which collectively accounted for a majority of our new product purchases in fiscal 2021. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary gaming product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection for our customers to purchase what they want, when and how they want it. We use our distribution facilities, store locations and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. In 2020, we introduced same day delivery service in certain markets to enhance the customer shopping and delivery experience. In 2021, we announced the expansion of our North American fulfillment network through the lease of facilities in Reno, Nevada and York, Pennsylvania. See

 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2021. OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its ecommerce properties and thousands of stores. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy, changed consumer behaviors and disrupted global supply chains, and may continue to do so. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments. See   

Item 1A of Part I, "Risk Factors" for additional information. BUSINESS PRIORITIES GameStop is on a strategic path to fully leverage our unique position and brand in gaming. GameStop is focused on transforming into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers and is actively focused on efforts to (1) establish ecommerce excellence (2) expand our selection to deliver a market-leading offering in gaming & entertainment, (3) leverage existing strengths and assets (4) invest in new growth opportunities. We are taking steps that include: • Increasing the size of our addressable market by offering vast product selection and growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality, blockchain technology, and other categories that represent the natural extensions of our business; • Expanding fulfillment operations to improve speed of delivery and service to our customers; • Building a superior customer experience, including by establishing a U.S.-based customer care operation supported by frictionless ecommerce and in-store experience; and • Strengthening technology capabilities, including by investing in new systems, modernized ecommerce assets and an expanded, experienced talent base. We believe these future transformation efforts are an important aspect of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. Accordingly, we prioritize long-term revenue growth and market leadership over short-term margins. In fiscal 2021 we further strengthened our balance sheet by eliminating $314.6 million of total outstanding debt and raising $1,672.8 million in gross equity capital through an at-the-market offering. The Company will continue to invest in growth initiatives, while continuing to prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet. Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See "Consolidated Results of Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses" for additional information. STORE COUNT INFORMATION The following table presents the number of stores by segment as of the end of fiscal 2021 compared to the end of fiscal 2020. 20 January 30, 2021 Net Disposals January 29, 2022 United States 3,192 (174) 3,018 Canada 253 (22) 231 Australia 417 — 417 Europe 954 (47) 907 Total Stores 4,816 (243) 4,573 SEASONALITY Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions, sales impacts related to temporary store closures, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we generated approximately 37% and 42%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. 21 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain statement of operations items (in millions) and as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Change Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales $ % Net sales $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ 5,089.8 100.0 % $ 920.9 18.1 % Cost of sales 4,662.9 77.6 3,830.3 75.3 832.6 21.7 % Gross profit 1,347.8 22.4 1,259.5 24.7 88.3 7.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,709.6 28.4 1,514.2 29.7 195.4 12.9 % Asset impairments 6.7 0.1 15.5 0.3 (8.8) (56.8) % Gain on sale of assets — — (32.4) (0.6) 32.4 100.0 % Operating loss (368.5) (6.1) (237.8) (4.7) (130.7) (55.0) % Interest expense, net 26.9 0.4 32.1 0.6 (5.2) (16.2) % Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (395.4) (6.6) (269.9) (5.3) (125.5) (46.5) % Benefit tax expense (14.1) (0.2) (55.3) (1.1) 41.2 74.5 % Net loss from continuing operations (381.3) (6.3) (214.6) (4.2) (166.7) (77.7) % Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax — — (0.7) — 0.7 100.0 % Net loss $ (381.3) (6.3) % $ (215.3) (4.2) % $ (166.0) (77.1) % Net Sales The following table presents net sales by significant product category: Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Change Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales $ % Hardware and accessories $ 3,171.7 52.8 % $ 2,530.8 49.7 % $ 640.9 25.3 % Software 2,014.8 33.5 1,979.1 38.9 35.7 1.8 % Collectibles 824.2 13.7 579.9 11.4 244.3 42.1 % Total $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ 5,089.8 100.0 % $ 920.9 18.1 % 22 The following table presents net sales by reportable segment: Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Change Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales $ % United States $ 4,186.5 69.7 % $ 3,417.1 67.1 % $ 769.4 22.5 % Canada 332.3 5.5 258.4 5.1 73.9 28.6 % Australia 591.8 9.8 625.3 12.3 (33.5) (5.4) % Europe 900.1 15.0 789.0 15.5 111.1 14.1 % Total $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ 5,089.8 100.0 % $ 920.9 18.1 % Net sales increased $920.9 million, or 18.1%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Net sales during fiscal 2021 in our United States, Canada and Europe segments improved by 22.5%, 28.6% and 14.1%, respectively, while net sales in our Australia segment decreased 5.4%, when compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to ongoing demand of the new gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, the continued sell-through of the Nintendo gaming product lines, an increase in store traffic compared to the prior year during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of our product category expansion efforts. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $88.3 million, or 7.0%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.4% in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.7% in fiscal 2020. Our gross profit for fiscal 2021 reflects a shift in product mix towards higher dollar lower margin categories such as new console hardware and increased freight and credit card fees associated with the shift to ecommerce sales. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased $195.4 million, or 12.9%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. SG&A expenses increased as a result of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on our store expenses in prior year as we experienced temporary store closures beginning in March of 2020. Contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses are costs associated with our transformation into a technology company, which include increased labor costs as the Company in-sources talent and expands its capabilities to support growth, severance expenses, and increased marketing and customer care costs. We expect to continue to incur costs associated with our transformation initiatives. The increase in SG&A expenses is partially offset by the continued benefit from lower store occupancy costs as a percent of sales driven by our cost reduction initiatives in 2020 and 2021. These net reductions include 243 permanent store closures since January 30, 2021. Asset Impairments Asset impairments decreased $8.8 million, or 56.8% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized $0.6 million in asset impairment charges related to our right-of-use lease assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we incurred impairment charges of $6.1 million related to store-level property and equipment, right-of-use asset and other asset impairment charges. See    

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 , "Asset Impairments," for additional information related to the impact on our segments. Gain on Sale of Assets During fiscal 2020 in separate unrelated transactions, and to unaffiliated third parties, we completed sale and leaseback transactions for our corporate headquarters, a refurbishment center, and ancillary office space in Grapevine, Texas for an aggregate total of $43.7 million, the sale of our Australian headquarters in Eagle Farm, Queensland for $27.0 million, and the sale of our Canadian headquarters in Brampton, Ontario for approximately $16.7 million. The net proceeds from the sale of these assets were used for general corporate purposes. As a result of the transactions that occurred during fiscal 2020, a gain on sale of assets of $32.4 million was recognized and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2020. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 , "Leases," for additional information regarding the sale and leaseback of these facilities. Interest Expense, Net 23 Interest expense, net decreased by $5.2 million, or 16.2%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the voluntary early redemption of the outstanding balance of our 2023 Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by a $17.8 million make-whole premium paid upon the voluntary early redemption of the outstanding balance of such notes. Income Tax We recognized an income tax benefit of $14.1 million representing an effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $55.3 million representing an effective tax rate of 20.5% in fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate of 3.6% is primarily due to not recognizing benefits on certain current period losses, the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Australia and New Zealand, as well as income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate of 20.5% in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets, a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities, and tax benefits associated with the availability of a five-year carryback period pursuant to the CARES Act. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. 24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and our revolving credit facilities. As of January 29, 2022, we had total unrestricted cash on hand of $1,271.4 million and an additional $389.6 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During fiscal 2021, we sold an aggregate of 8,500,000 shares of our common stock under our at-the market equity offering program (the "ATM Transactions"). We generated $1.68 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from sales under the ATM Transactions, and paid an aggregate of $10.1 million in commissions to the sales agent, among other legal and administrative fees. The net proceeds generated from sales under the ATM Transactions have been, and are expected to be, used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding our transformation, growth initiatives and product category expansion efforts, capital expenditures and the satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2021, we repaid the remaining $73.2 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ("2021 Senior Notes") and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 10.00% Senior Notes due 2023 ("2023 Senior Notes"). In connection with the voluntary early redemption of our 2023 Senior Notes, we paid a $17.8 million make-whole premium. In the first quarter of 2021, we repaid our then outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility due November 2022 ("2022 Revolver"). In the second quarter of 2021, at the request of Micromania SAS, the six separate unsecured term loans held by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, for a total of €40.0 million ($44.6 million as of January 29, 2022) were extended for five years. On November 3, 2021, we entered into an asset-based secured revolving credit facility which provides for a borrowing capacity of $500 million with a maturity date of November 3, 2026 (the "2026 Revolver"). See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14 , "Debt," for additional information. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance, our commitments and obligations, our capital requirements, limitations imposed under our credit arrangements and overall market conditions. We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under the 2026 Revolver to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of U.S.and Government Prime money market funds and cash deposits with commercial banks. Separate from the 2026 Revolver, we issue letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of January 29, 2022, we had $92.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and other bank guarantees under facilities outside of the 2026 Revolver. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14 , "Debt," for additional information. Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 2021 2020 Change Cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (434.3) $ 123.7 $ (558.0) Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (64.8) 36.9 (101.7) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,200.6 (55.4) 1,256.0 Exchange rate effect on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (16.6) 16.3 (32.9) Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 684.9 $ 121.5 $ 563.4 Operating Activities In fiscal 2021, cash used in operating activities was $434.3 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $123.7 million in fiscal 2020. Cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in merchandise inventory levels when compared to prior year to, among other things, support our product category expansion efforts, and to mitigate the full impact of global supply chain issues. The increase in merchandise inventory levels was 25 accompanied by an increase in associated payables. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to improvements in working capital as a result of optimizing inventory and accounts payable levels through the cash conversion cycle and more efficient carrying levels of inventory. Investing activities In fiscal 2021, cash used in investing activities was $64.8 million compared to cash provided by investing activities of $36.9 million in fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to continued technological investments, and investments in two new fulfillment centers. Cash provided by investing activities in the fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of properties including our corporate headquarters, a refurbishment center and ancillary office space in Grapevine, Texas of $43.7 million, the sale of our Australian headquarters in Eagle Farm, Queensland for $27.0 million, the sale of our Canadian headquarters in Brampton, Ontario for approximately $16.7 million, and net proceeds of $8.6 million from the sale of our corporate aircraft Financing activities In fiscal 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $1,200.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $55.4 million in fiscal 2020. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the sale of shares of our common stock in connection with the ATM transactions for aggregate net proceeds of $1.673 billion. These proceeds were partially offset by a payment of $136.8 million for withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock, repaid at maturity $73.2 million of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes, and the voluntary early redemption of our outstanding 2023 Senior Notes for an aggregate of $234.2 million. We also repaid $25.0 million of our outstanding borrowing under our 2022 Revolver. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 was primarily due to the repayment of $130.3 million of our 2021 Senior Notes through a combination of open market transactions and an optional early redemption of $125.0 million of our 2021 Senior Notes, at par, in December 2020, partially offset by a net $25.0 million draw down on our 2022 Revolver and $47.1 million in proceeds from term loans entered into by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS. Share Repurchases On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization allowing us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our Class A Common Stock. The authorization has no expiration date. On June 11, 2019, we commenced a modified Dutch auction tender offer for up to 12.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock with a price range between $5.20 and $6.00 per share. The tender offer expired on July 10, 2019. Through the tender offer, we accepted for payment 12.0 million shares at a purchase price of $5.20 per share for a total of $62.9 million, including fees and commissions. The shares purchased through the tender offer were immediately retired. In addition to the equity tender offer described above, during the second half of fiscal 2019, we executed a series of open market repurchases for an aggregate of 26.1 million shares of our Class A Common Stock totaling $135.8 million, including fees and commissions. These repurchased shares were immediately retired. In aggregate, during fiscal 2019, we repurchased a total of 38.1 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, totaling $198.7 million, for an average price of $5.19 per share. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020. As of January 29, 2022, we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 29, 2022 other than those disclosed 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16 , "Commitments and Contingencies". CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, N ote 2 , "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories 26 Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned gaming systems traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value. A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at January 29, 2022 would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.6 million in fiscal 2021. Customer Liabilities Our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards and discounts. We allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration. The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated amount of points that will never be redeemed, which is a concept known in the retail industry as "breakage." Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer and recognize estimated breakage on gift cards in proportion to historical redemption patterns. The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average retail price per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. We estimate breakage of loyalty points and unredeemed gift cards based on historical redemption rates. The weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual loyalty point redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption values, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, retail price per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average retail price per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue balance through current period revenue by an amount estimated to cover the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average retail value per point redeemed at January 29, 2022, in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $4.6 million in fiscal 2021. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at January 29, 2022 would have affected net earnings by approximately $11.2 million in fiscal 2021. Income Taxes We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Based on our analysis, we have determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowances increased to $338.3 million as of January 29, 2022, primarily due to cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $12.9 million as of January 29, 2022. Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing 27 authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 , "New Accounting Pronouncements," for recent accounting standards and pronouncements. 

  ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, each as described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. The forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans. We recognized a gain of $9.6 million and a loss of $6.1 million in SG&A expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative instruments for the fiscal years ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. The aggregate fair value of the forward exchange contracts as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 was a net asset of $3.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of January 29, 2022 would result in a gain of $12.9 million or a loss of $10.6 million in value of the forwards, options and swaps. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults.

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5 , "Segment Information," of this Form 10-K. 1 Merchandise We categorize our sale of products as follows: • Hardware and accessories. We offer new and pre-owned gaming platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Nintendo Switch. Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, and virtual reality products. • Software. We offer new and pre-owned gaming software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content and full-game downloads. • Collectibles. Collectibles consist of apparel, toys, trading cards, gadgets, and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts, and our digital asset wallet and NFT marketplace activities. Trade-In Program We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned gaming, mobility, and other products at our stores in exchange for cash or credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. This process drives higher market share and offers a broader range of price points for our customers. Our trade-in program provides customers a means to unlock value and recycle used product, which enables us to offer previous generation platforms and related games. We operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where used gaming, mobility and other products can be tested, repaired, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for sale. Sustainability We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take gaming consoles, gaming software and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2022 alone, through our United States refurbishment center, we refurbished over 0.9 million pieces of software discs and over 2.8 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 0.7 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease in the United States over our baseline year of 2009. In 2022, we achieved a reduction in year over year carbon emissions in excess of 10% in the United States through both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. 2 Store Locations Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 28, 2023, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,413 stores worldwide as more specifically set forth below: Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the United States segment.

Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability in the near term, while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries. GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives: • Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms.  To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, better product availability across all channels, improved fulfillment speed, partnerships and store concepts to attract new customers, and a further improved customer service experience. • Achieve Profitability. During fiscal 2022, we optimized our corporate cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs following the completion of a majority of the necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we streamline parts of the organization where we can operate with increased efficiency. • Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth. GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets  to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers. We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth. We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. PowerUp Rewards Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards ® ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 56.7 million members as of January 28, 2023, of which approximately 15.0 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop ® in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 5.6 million paying pro members. Our loyalty program generally offers our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership, the latter of which gives our customers access to exclusive gaming related rewards. The program's paid membership generally include a subscription to Game Informer ® magazine and additional discounts and benefits in our stores and ecommerce platforms. 4 Game Informer ® We publish Game Informer ® , a leading gaming publication featuring reviews of new releases, previews of the big titles on the horizon, and coverage of the latest developments in the gaming industry. The magazine is available by subscription, in both digital and physical formats and is sold both online and in-store. Game Informer ® is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards Pro membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer ® are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer ® operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. Vendors We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Our largest vendors are Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft, which collectively accounted for a majority of our new product purchases in fiscal 2022. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary gaming product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations. Distribution and Information Management Our operating strategy involves providing a convenient and broad merchandise selection for our customers. We use our distribution facilities, store locations and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. Competition The gaming industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, computer product and consumer electronics stores, other gaming and related specialty stores, toy retail chains, direct sales by software publishers, the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers, game rental companies, and Web 3.0 platforms. Gaming products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value gaming products and other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. In the United States, we compete with Walmart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), Target Corporation (“Target”), Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy"), and Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as FNAC-Darty and Media Markt-Saturn, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Walmart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include JB HiFi stores, Big W, Target, and Amazon.com. Globally, we also compete with certain vendors including Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft among others, for direct-to-consumer offerings. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions, sales impacts related to temporary store closures, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 38% and 37%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. Trademarks We have a number of trademarks and service marks, including “GameStop ® ,” “Game Informer ® ,” “EB Games ® ,” “EB Electronics Boutique ® ,"” “Power to the Players ® ," and “PowerUp Rewards ® ,” and "PowerUp Rewards Pro ® ," which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and service marks, including “Micromania ® ” and "Zing Pop Culture ® ," we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. 5 Human Capital At GameStop, we strive to attract, retain and develop talent at all levels of our organization. We have approximately 11,000 full-time salaried and hourly associates and between 14,000 and 27,000 part-time hourly associates worldwide, depending on the time of year. The number of part-time hourly associates fluctuates primarily due to the seasonality of our business.  Our human resource philosophy is based on the following tenets: • Development. We are committed to providing our associates with opportunities to develop and grow their careers. We offer learning opportunities through our training programs and high-potential talent development programs as well as educational assistance programs. • Diversity and Inclusion. We advocate working actively to build understanding and collaboration across functions. We believe a more diverse workforce provides many benefits in drawing upon a greater richness of resources, experiences, ideas and talents. • Benefits. We have designed our compensation and benefits programs to meet the unique needs of employees in our various business segments. These programs are intended to attract, reward and retain talent that reflects local communities and customers, while instilling an ownership mentality in our work. We are also committed to taking care of our associates in times of need. Through our Gamer Fund employee assistance program, an employee sponsored 501(c)(3) organization, we have provided temporary assistance to more than 3,900 GameStop associates who have experienced unforeseen emergency or hardship, and more than $750,000 in scholarships.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), before you make an investment decision with respect to our Company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock and the value of your investment. Economic and Industry Risks Economic, social and political conditions in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect demand for the products we sell and impact our business and financial condition. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers, making our results highly dependent on the health of the economies and consumer confidence in the markets in which we operate. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing gaming and technology products, when there are favorable economic conditions. Our business may be affected by many economic, social, and political factors outside our control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, interest rates, tax rates, housing market conditions, inflation, tariffs, socio-political factors, such as civil unrest or political uncertainty, and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and public health crises. Adverse economic, social and political changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products could adversely affect our business in many ways, including reduced sales and margins. We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, ecommerce businesses and others, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. The retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Walmart and Target, computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy, other United States and international gaming and PC software specialty stores, such as FNAC Darty, and Media Markt-Saturn, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, toy retail chains, internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com, other internet marketplaces, including those operated by game publishers and console manufacturers, online retailers of digital software and game rental companies. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, such actions may negatively impact our business and our financial performance. Multi-channel retailers and ecommerce companies continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products. The gaming industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products. The gaming industry has historically been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new gaming platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. A new console cycle began with the launch of the Sony PlayStation 5 in November 2020, the Microsoft Xbox Series X in November 2020 and the Nintendo Switch in March 2017. We are dependent upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors and failure to timely obtain new product can adversely affect our sales. We depend on manufacturers and publishers to deliver video game hardware, software and consumer electronics in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Some of the products we sell are in short supply and are highly allocated among us and our competitors and we compete for product inventory. If we fail to obtain products in sufficient quantities, our sales may be negatively impacted. We depend on these manufacturers and publishers to introduce new and innovative products and software titles to drive industry sales. The number of new software titles available for sale has decreased in recent years. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms or software titles could result in reduced sales. In addition, some publishers that have historically published games compatible with multiple gaming platforms have recently 7 been acquired by console manufacturers. This consolidation could lead to a further reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment hardware and software available to consumers, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, have lowered and may continue to lower, our sales. The current consoles from Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. Downloading of video game content to the current generation video game systems continues to grow and take an increasing percentage of new video game sales. If consumers’ preference for downloading video game content in lieu of physical software continues to increase, our business and financial performance may be adversely impacted. In addition, both Sony and Microsoft currently offer consoles that only allow for the purchase of digital games and content and do not work with physical software. Sales of those types of consoles eliminate the ability of customers to purchase physical software, which may also adversely affect our sales of both new and pre-owned physical software. Interruptions to our supply chain or the supply chain of our suppliers may adversely affect our business Our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including labor shortages, natural disasters, public health crises, or the imposition of import or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 38% and 37%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year and adversely impact our liquidity. Our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers and service providers may impact our financial results. Our financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers and service providers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors.  If our suppliers and service providers do not provide us with favorable business terms or allocate reduced volumes of their products to us, we may not be able to offer products to our customers in sufficient volumes or at competitive prices. Vendors may request credit support which could require us to either use cash on hand or collateralize letters of credit with restricted cash or other credit support mechanisms, which would reduce our liquidity available for other purposes. Our sales of collectibles depend on popularity and trends in pop culture, and if we are unable to anticipate, identify and react to them, our sales and business may be adversely affected. Our sales of collectibles are heavily dependent upon the continued demand by our customers for collectibles, apparel, toys, trading cards gadgets, electronics and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts. The popularity of such products is often driven by movies, television shows, music, fashion and other pop culture influences. Our failure to anticipate, identify and react appropriately to changing trends and preferences of customers could lead to, among other things, excess inventories and higher markdowns. Strategic Risks If we are unable to successfully maintain strong retail and ecommerce experiences for our customers, our sales and results of operations could adversely be impacted. Our business has become increasingly dependent on multiple sales channels as we strive to deliver a seamless shopping experience to our customers through both online and in-store shopping experiences. Operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software and other related operational systems. If we are not able to successfully operate our ecommerce platform, we may not be able to provide a relevant shopping experience or improve customer traffic, sales or margins, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. 8 In-store and ecommerce retail are competitive and evolving environments. Insufficient, untimely or inadequately prioritized or ineffectively implemented investments could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones. If we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. The interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including video game consoles, personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites, and other devices. Browser, mobile and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. In addition, augmented reality, virtual reality and blockchain technology continue to rapidly evolve and may result in changes in both customer preferences and the types of hardware and software that are used by customers. To continue to compete effectively in the gaming and interactive entertainment industry, we must respond effectively to market and technological changes and understand their impact on our customers’ preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to keep pace with these changes. If we are unable to successfully manage our profitability and cost reduction initiatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. As part of our strategic plan to achieve profitability and considering the current challenging economic environment highlighted by high inflation, we have recently undertaken cost reduction measures and other initiatives to improve the efficiency of our operations, including initiatives to reduce headcount. These initiatives could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties in managing our business, including difficulties in hiring, managing, and retaining employees. If we do not adapt, we may experience erosion to our brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer and our operating results may be negatively impacted. Changes in our senior management or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our success depends, in part, on the continuing services and contributions of our leadership team to execute on our strategic plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Turnover in key leadership positions in the Company could adversely affect our ability to manage the Company efficiently and effectively, could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of current personnel, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our success also depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key executives, management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail and fulfillment industries is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store and fulfillment associates. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified associates include associate morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefits packages. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or retain key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business and our ability to attract and retain customers and employees. Our continued success depends upon customers’ perception of our Company. Any negative publicity relating to our vendors, products, associates and Board members, practices or our Company could damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and employees. Failure to detect, prevent or mitigate issues that might give rise to reputational risk or failure to adequately address negative publicity or perceptions could adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our new digital asset products and services may not achieve our desired results and may expose us to new risks. In late May 2022, we launched a beta browser extension version of a non-custodial digital asset wallet, which allows gamers and other users to manage, send, receive and use cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and other digital assets across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched a beta version of our peer-to-peer NFT marketplace, 9 which allows gamers, creators, collectors and other users to publish, view, buy and sell NFTs, and allows creators selected by us to create NFTs on certain decentralized cryptographic protocols. In November 2022, we launched a beta iOS version of the non-custodial digital asset wallet on the iOS App Store. We are also pursuing, and plan to continue to pursue, other business and strategic initiatives associated with digital assets and blockchain technology. The digital asset economy is highly competitive and rapidly evolving with frequent launches of new or improved products and services, and frequent entries of new competitors in the United States and internationally. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully implement and operate these digital assets initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing these initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as the generation of additional revenues. Our digital asset initiatives also subjects us to risks similar to those associated with any new product offerings, including, but not limited to, our ability to accurately anticipate market demand and acceptance, creator and buyer acceptance, technical issues with the operation of the products, and legal and regulatory risks as discussed herein. Operational Risks If we do not maintain the security or privacy of our customer, associate or company information, we could impact our operations, damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. An important part of our business involves the receipt, processing and storage of personal information of our customers and associates, including, in the case of customers, payment information. We have systems and processes in place that are designed to protect against security and data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information, and are constantly working to upgrade these systems and processes. Despite these efforts, we have been the target of cybersecurity attacks in the past and there is no guarantee that the procedures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access are adequate. A successful cybersecurity attack could lead to significant disruptions in the operations of our systems and business, including our ability to accept payment from customers, unauthorized release of confidential information, including customer payment information and corruption of data. Any such cybersecurity attack may also require significant investment and resources to identify and remediate, may expose us to costly litigation, government investigations, government enforcement actions, fines and/or lawsuits and may significantly harm our reputation with our customers. Weather, natural disasters, public health crises and other unexpected events could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various unexpected events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Such events may be caused by, for example: natural disasters or extreme weather events; diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners; floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; cybersecurity attacks, power outages and telecommunications failures affecting our systems; or terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. Such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores, logistics facilities and other properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and refurbishment operations. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of these or other events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We seek to mitigate our exposure to these disruptions in several ways. For example, where feasible, we design the configuration of our logistics facilities to reduce the consequences of disasters and other disruptions. We also maintain insurance for these facilities against casualties, and we evaluate our risks and develop contingency plans for dealing with them. Although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of disruption risks applicable to our logistics operations, the ones that actually affect us may not be those that we have concluded are most likely to occur. Furthermore, our plans may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disruption event that we may encounter. 10 If our systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted. We rely on computerized systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our operations, including our ecommerce, store and fulfillment operations. If any of these systems fail to adequately perform their functions, including our point-of-sale, inventory management, information technology or enterprise management systems, our business could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party delivery services to deliver products to our retail locations, fulfillment centers and customers on a timely and consistent basis, and changes in the terms we have with these service providers could adversely affect our business and financial position. We rely on third parties for the transportation of products and we cannot be sure that these services will continue to be provided on terms favorable to us, or at all. Delivery and shipping costs have increased from time to time and may continue to increase, and we may not be able to pass these costs directly to our customers. Any increased delivery and shipping costs could harm our business and financial performance by increasing our costs of doing business and reducing our margins. If our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired, if we are unable to negotiate acceptable terms with these third parties or if these third parties are unable to deliver products for us, whether due to a labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, or for any other reason, we would be required to use alternative carriers for the shipment of products to our retail locations, fulfillment centers and customers. Changing carriers could have a negative effect on our business and operating results due to the negative impact on customer experience, including reduced visibility of order status and package tracking and delays in order processing and product delivery, and we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis, upon terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, these third parties have increasingly had demand for their services exceed capacity, in particular during the holiday selling season, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient services to meet our demand or to timely meet our customers' expectations. If our vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted. The manufacturers of gaming products have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, we receive cooperative advertising and market development payments from these vendors which enable us to actively promote and merchandise the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. If our vendors fail to continue to provide this support at historical levels, our business and financial condition may be negatively impacted. Restrictions on our ability to purchase and sell pre-owned products could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Our financial results depend on our ability to purchase and sell pre-owned products. Actions by manufacturers or publishers of products or governmental authorities to prohibit or limit our ability to purchase or sell pre-owned products, or to limit the ability of consumers to use pre-owned products, could have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our earnings may be adversely affected. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot ensure that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, or locate alternative sites. Digital assets are a novel asset class that carries unique risks, including extreme price volatility. Cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, coins, tokens, NFTs, stablecoins, and other digital or crypto assets or instruments that are issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology (collectively referred to herein as “digital assets”) are a new and evolving asset class. The characteristics of particular digital assets within this broad asset class may differ significantly. We receive payments in digital assets in connection with certain of our digital asset products and services. We also invest, and may invest in the future, directly or indirectly, in or through digital assets. There is no guarantee that these investments will maintain their value as measured against fiat currencies. Digital assets continue to be an emerging asset 11 class based on emerging technologies, and investment in digital assets is subject to a number of factors relating to the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies, such as the infancy of their development, their dependence on the internet and other technologies, their dependence on the role played by miners, validators and developers and the potential for malicious activity, among other factors. Further, there can be no assurance that the blockchain technology on which digital assets are transacted does not have undiscovered flaws that may allow for such digital assets to be compromised, resulting in the loss of some or all of our investments in such digital assets. Finally, the intrinsic value of digital assets is particularly uncertain and difficult to determine due to the novel and rapidly changing nature of digital asset markets. There can be no assurance that digital assets will maintain their value in the future, or that acceptance of using digital assets as currency or to make payments will continue. Moreover, due to the novelty of the asset class and the evolving patchwork of regulatory oversight of digital asset markets, fraud and market manipulation are not uncommon in such markets, all of which could negatively impact the value of our digital asset investments and have an adverse impact on the value of an investment in our business. We use third parties to custody most of our digital asset investments. The financial institutions, exchanges or other third parties we select to custody our digital assets may become insolvent or subject to cybersecurity attacks, which may in turn cause us to lose all or a portion of our digital assets held by those custodians. While we select custodians that do not rehypothecate or otherwise use our digital asset deposits, we cannot guarantee that these third parties securely maintain our deposits at all times. If, despite our contractual agreements, our selected custodians do rehypothecate or otherwise use our digital asset deposits, they may be unable to accommodate our digital asset withdrawals depending on the nature of the rehypothecation. Furthermore, in the event of bankruptcy of such a custodian, our digital assets held by that third party could, depending on the manner in which such assets are held, be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate and we could be treated as a general unsecured creditor in bankruptcy proceedings. Even if the digital assets held by the custodian are not considered the property of the service provider’s bankruptcy estate, the return of our digital assets may be delayed or affected while the bankruptcy proceeding is pending. Such results may lead to losses for us and have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to find, or maintain relationships with, banks or other financial institutions to support our digital asset initiatives, it may impact our ability to offer certain of our digital asset products and services. Some established banks and other financial institutions have been unwilling to provide banking services to digital asset companies. Following several high-profile bankruptcies in the digital asset industry and recent bank failures, which involved banks that provided banking services to digital asset companies, there has been heightened regulatory scrutiny of the digital asset industry as a whole, and more banks may become reluctant to provide services to digital asset industry participants.  In addition, we rely on third party custodians to hold and regularly liquidate the digital assets we receive into U.S. dollars, and our digital asset custodians must have access to banking services to provide these services.  If we, or our custodial partners, are unable to maintain banking relationships on acceptable terms, it may negatively affect our ability to offer certain digital asset products and services. Digital assets may be subject to hacking, social engineering and other cyber attacks, which could subject us to monetary losses, user disputes, reputational harm, and regulatory scrutiny. Digital products and services are inherently digital and therefore subject to a heightened risk of hacking, cyber attacks and other cybersecurity threats. We have taken certain steps to mitigate against those risks. Despite these efforts, the safeguards we have implemented or may implement in the future to protect against cybersecurity threats may be insufficient to prevent malicious activities, and if our products and services are exploited and our digital assets are stolen, we could experience significant financial harm. Actual or perceived breaches or cybersecurity attacks directed to other digital asset platforms or services could also create a general loss of customer confidence in the digital asset industry and the use of blockchain technologies, which could negatively impact the demand for our products and harm our reputation. If our systems, the blockchain networks on which our digital asset products and services are offered, or our third party partners fail to perform or are inadequate, we may experience adverse consequences, including financial losses, customer dissatisfaction and reputational harm. Similar to other aspects of our business, our digital asset products and services are reliant on certain third party partners, including, but not limited to, fiat-to-crypto onramp providers, cloud computing services and data centers. Because we rely on third parties to provide these services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risks. These third parties may be subject to legal, regulatory, financial, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, interruptions, disruptions, and other similar issues. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, fires, natural disasters (including, but not limited to, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and tornados), power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorism, vandalism, pandemics and similar events. Additionally, these third parties may breach their agreements with us or refuse to continue to renew their agreements on commercially reasonable terms, 12 or at all. There can be no assurances that third parties that provide products or services to us or our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any of these third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our users, or if such third party partners decide to or are required by law to suspend or shut down products or services that we are relying on, we may be unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. In addition, we rely on one or more transaction protocols referred to as “smart contracts,” which include the cryptographic operations that verify and secure transactions, in connection with our digital asset products or services. A smart contract is software that digitally facilitates or enforces a rules-agreement or terms between transacting parties. If the smart contracts fail to behave as expected, suffer cybersecurity attacks or security issues, become obsolete, or encounter other issues, certain transactions may not be completed or may be erroneously executed, and we and our users may experience significant harm, including irretrievable loss of digital assets. Peer-to-peer NFT marketplaces create unique risks and challenges related to content moderation and control. If we are unable to navigate these issues, demand for the marketplace could be adversely impacted. The creator of an NFT will often have, or purport to have, all necessary rights to the content of the NFT and can determine what rights to assign to a buyer, such as the right to display, modify, publicly perform, or copy the content. Risks associated with purchasing or selling items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, include, among other things, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items or items alleged to be counterfeit, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs or malware, items related to content that infringes intellectual property rights, and items that may become untransferable, inoperable or obsolete. Our involvement, directly or indirectly, in a dispute between creators and buyers on our NFT marketplace, could adversely affect the success of our NFT marketplace and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may also experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions related to our content moderation practices with respect to our NFT marketplace either as a result of our perceived failure to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of content perceived as objectionable or as a result of our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our NFT marketplace by persons who violate our content standards and Terms of Service. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and demand for our NFT marketplace, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Unfavorable changes in our global tax rate could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be higher than other companies or higher than our tax rates have been in the past. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our business and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. A change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any jurisdiction in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of our operations. We also continue to monitor developments related to tax legislation and government policy, including corporate tax reform. The impact of these potential changes to our business and consolidated financial results cannot be determined until the relevant legislation and policies are finalized. Legislative actions may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase and impact our operations and financial condition. To comply with laws adopted by the United States government or other United States or foreign regulatory bodies, we may be required to increase our expenditures and hire additional personnel and additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase. Significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer’s obligation to recognize collective 13 bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment affecting Medicare reimbursements, workplace safety, product safety, privacy and security of customer data, responsible sourcing, environmental protection, and supply chain transparency, and increased compliance costs related to wage and hour statutes, limitations on arbitration/class action waiver agreements and overtime regulations, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. Failure to comply with federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, and statutes applicable to our business could result in an adverse impact to our business and financial condition. As a seller of consumer products, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and statutes, including laws relating to product safety and consumer protection and privacy. While we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties which could have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. In addition, our suppliers might not adhere to product safety requirements and the Company and those suppliers may therefore be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs, lost sales and reputational damage associated with product recalls, government enforcement actions, or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. While we have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws, our associates, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Any violations of these laws by any of these persons could have a negative impact on our business. Government regulation of certain of our potential business initiatives are evolving, and we may experience unfavorable changes in or failure to comply with existing or future regulations and laws. The Company continues to explore new business initiatives, including initiatives related to blockchain, digital assets, NFTs and Web 3.0 technology. These potential business initiatives involve a complex and rapidly evolving mixture of laws and regulations enacted and implemented by U.S., state and local and foreign governments and regulatory authorities. Given the unique and novel nature of the underlying technologies associated with these potential business initiatives, governments and regulatory authorities continue to expand, modify, interpret and re-interpret frequently the legal and regulatory frameworks applied to these initiatives. Such legal and regulatory frameworks may be applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, which may result in conflicting frameworks with one another. Moreover, since there is significant uncertainty associated with the laws and regulations concerning such potential business initiatives, we are required to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws or regulations apply to the Company and the potential business initiatives or may apply in the future, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and the courts may disagree with our conclusions. As blockchain-based services and products continue to evolve, increasing legislation, regulation and enforcement efforts by federal, state and foreign legislators and agencies, respectively, and the prospect of private litigation claims related to such services and products become more likely, which may negatively impact such potential business initiatives. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations, or the imposition of other legal requirements, that may adversely affect our ability to market, sell, and deliver digital assets or other blockchain-based services or products could decrease our ability to offer, or customer demand for, our product offerings, resulting in lower net revenue, and existing or future laws or regulations could impair our ability to provide or expand our product offerings, which could also result in lower net revenue and make us more vulnerable to increased competition. Future regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could also require us to change our business practices, raise compliance or litigation costs or other costs of doing business and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Litigation and the outcomes of such litigation could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various litigation and legal proceedings, including matters involving wage and hour associate class actions, stockholder and consumer class actions, tax audits and unclaimed property audits by states. The outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and the magnitude of potential losses therefrom, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Certain of these legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may require changes to our business operations that negatively impact our operating results or involve significant liability awards that impact our financial condition. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. As a result, legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 14 Our digital asset products and services may expose us to legal, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. As digital assets are a relatively new and emerging asset class, the regulatory, commercial, and legal framework governing digital assets and associated products and services is likely to evolve both in the United States and internationally and implicates issues regarding a range of matters, including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, consumer protection, privacy and cybersecurity, anti-money laundering (“AML”), sanctions and currency, tax, money transmission, commodity, and securities law compliance. In addition, following the failure of several prominent crypto trading venues and lending platforms in 2022, the United States Congress expressed the need for both greater federal oversight of digital assets and comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. In the near future, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including in the United States, may introduce new policies, laws, and regulations relating to digital assets generally, and digital asset platforms in particular. We may need to comply with new licensing or registration requirements, revise our compliance and risk mitigation measures, institute a ban on certain digital assets or transactions thereof, and/or suspend or shut down our products or services in one or more jurisdictions. We may also face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with new legal or regulatory requirements. It is difficult to predict how the legal and regulatory framework and oversight/enforcement infrastructure around digital assets will develop and how such developments will impact our business and these new product offerings since the market for digital assets, and NFTs in particular, is relatively nascent. Particular digital assets that we support could be deemed securities, and we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business. We operate our digital asset-related products and services in a complex and frequently evolving regulatory environment and are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted and enforced by U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign governments and regulatory authorities. With respect to securities laws, the SEC, U.S. state, and foreign government regulators have taken varying positions regarding whether certain digital assets fall within the definition of a “security” under U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws, respectively. The determination as to whether a digital asset is a security is a fact-driven analysis and the outcome may be difficult to predict. Also, securities laws and regulations are constantly evolving. Accordingly, the SEC, U.S. state, and/or foreign government regulators could take the position that certain digital assets we support through our digital asset-based products or services are deemed “securities” under their definitions and interpretations. We have policies and procedures in place that are intended to enable us to make a reasonable, risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular digital asset could be deemed a security under applicable laws. These policies and procedures are not legal determinations as to whether any particular digital asset is a security under federal securities laws. However, the application of securities laws to the specific facts and circumstances of digital assets is complex and subject to change, and it is possible that regulators may disagree with our conclusions. There is no certainty that any digital assets are not securities, notwithstanding the conclusions drawn based on our risk-based assessment. We could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event a regulatory authority or court were to determine that a digital asset offered, sold or traded on our non-custodial digital asset wallet product or NFT marketplace is a security under applicable laws, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, to the extent that any of the digital assets we support are deemed securities, we may be required to register as a broker-dealer and/or national securities exchange with the SEC and/or foreign regulatory counterpart, or rely on an available exemption from registration. Law enforcement and regulators may initiate investigations or litigation related to our digital asset investments, products or services. New or revised regulations or policies affecting digital assets and blockchain technology, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by governmental and regulatory bodies in respect of digital assets and blockchain technology could have substantial and adverse effect on our digital asset investments, products or services. As such, we could in the future be subject to inquiries or investigations from regulators and governmental authorities, be required to divest our digital asset holdings, make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, including our users’ acquisition, use or redemption of certain digital assets, and be required to implement additional and potentially costly controls. In addition, if we expand our digital asset business to new products and services, we could come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators, both with respect to jurisdiction and subject matter. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in these risk factors, may (i) subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, enforcement proceedings, and forfeiture of significant assets, (ii) result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increased regulatory scrutiny of our business and restrictions of our operations, and (iii) force us to modify our business practices, make product or operational changes, and/or delay planned product launches or improvements. We currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 15 Violations of law by third parties using our digital asset products or services could expose us to litigation risk and negatively impact our reputation. We have no control over the third parties utilizing our digital asset products or services, such as digital gaming and entertainment developers and other NFT creators and sellers. Any failure or perceived failure by such third parties to comply with existing civil and criminal laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and anti-financial crime laws, may also subject us to significant reputational and litigation risks, including criminal and civil lawsuits. We require third parties using our digital products or services to confirm that their digital asset activities will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with their use of our digital products or services, but there can be no assurance that these third parties will do so. Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets under U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely impact our business. Current tax rules related to digital assets are in some instances unclear and require significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the law, including but not limited to the areas of income tax, information reporting, transaction level taxes and the withholding of tax at source. Additional legislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing bodies that may differ significantly from our practices or interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Our digital asset products and services require compliance with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. We comply with laws and regulations related to U.S. AML and counter-terrorist financing (“CTF”) laws and regulations, enforced by the United States Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), and economic sanctions enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) in connection with our digital asset products and services. U.S. sanctions laws and regulations generally restrict persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction from dealings with certain jurisdictions that are the target of comprehensive embargoes, as well as with persons, entities, and governments identified on certain prohibited party lists. We have an OFAC compliance program in place that includes monitoring of IP addresses to identify prohibited jurisdictions and of digital wallet addresses that have either been identified by OFAC as prohibited or that otherwise are believed by us to be associated with prohibited persons or jurisdictions. Regardless, there can be no guarantee that our compliance program will prevent transactions with particular persons or addresses or prevent every potential violation of OFAC sanctions. Any present or future government inquiries relating to sanctions could result in negative consequences for us, including costs related to government investigations, financial penalties, and harm to our reputation. Further, new or revised U.S. or foreign AML, CTF or sanctions laws and regulations could require us to invest substantially in new compliance measures and that may require significant retroactive compliance efforts that could adversely affect our financial position, as well as give rise to liabilities based on our compliance program. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: • “short squeezes”; • comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media; • large stockholders exiting their position in our Class A Common Stock or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our Class A Common Stock; • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results; • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; 16 • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry; and • overall general market fluctuations. Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our Company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. These and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock. A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock. Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has previously led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment. Information available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate. We have received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by our officers or associates. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate and could materially impact the trading price of our Class A Common Stock which could cause stockholders to lose their investments. A large number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock and may be dilutive to current stockholders. The sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the price for our Class A Common Stock. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of additional authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock or other authorized but unissued securities at any time, including pursuant to equity incentive plans. In addition, we have filed a registration statement with the SEC, allowing us to offer, from time to time and at any time, equity securities (including common or preferred stock), subject to market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of our Class A common stock pursuant to an at-the-market program, based upon market conditions and other factors. Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. Our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, 17 may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws (or pursuant to our securities trading policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws), including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of material nonpublic information, we have no restrictions on the right of our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, to sell their unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock. Risks Related to Financial Performance and Reporting Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches; • the amounts devoted to strategic investments, including in multi-channel capabilities and other business initiatives, and failure to achieve anticipated profitability and benefits from such initiatives within the expected time-frames, or at all; • the timing and extent of the achievement of anticipated profits from investments, if at all; • shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings; • the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate; • the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate; • the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores; and • changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts. The agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our current and future operations. The agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including limitations on additional liens, investments, acquisitions, loans, guarantees, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, certain fundamental changes, certain dispositions, certain dividends and distributions and certain related party transactions. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default. Such an event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing necessary to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Accordingly, these restrictions may affect our ability to operate in accordance with our strategy. To fund our operations, we require cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet such obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our business will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our business, we may have to sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or, that additional capital could be raised. 18 We and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage. Although our revolving credit facility agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Such future indebtedness or obligations may have restrictions similar to, or more restrictive than, those included in our revolving credit facility agreement. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our implementation of a new ERP system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented a new ERP system, SAP, as part of a plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. Additional implementation activities are expected to continue in phases over the next few years. ERP implementations are complex, labor intensive and time-consuming projects and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. The ERP system is critical to our ability to provide important information to our management, obtain and deliver products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, and otherwise operate our business. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. The implementation and maintenance of the new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources, the re-engineering of processes of our business, and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience time delays or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, or if we are unable to reap the benefits we expect from the ERP system. Any material deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could also result in potentially materially higher costs than we had incurred previously and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and otherwise negatively impact our financial reporting and internal controls. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, our business may be adversely affected and we may lose market confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely impact our business and stock price. Effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report financial information timely and accurately could be adversely affected. As a result, we could lose investor confidence and become subject to litigation or investigations, which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and our stock price. Recent digital asset market developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on the price of digital assets and cause reputational harm to the industry. In the past year, multiple digital asset platforms have commenced bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, including Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc., Celsius Network, Ltd. (“Celsius”), FTX Trading Ltd. ("FTX"), BlockFi Inc., and Genesis Global Holdco, LLC. These digital asset platforms commenced bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in large part because the platforms did not have sufficient funds or digital assets available to satisfy the claims and entitlements of their customers and account holders. The bankruptcy proceedings for each of these platforms remain ongoing, and the treatment and recoveries of account holders and creditors of these digital asset platforms is largely undetermined. While there have been recent rulings by the bankruptcy court in the Celsius case regarding ownership of digital assets in two different types of digital asset accounts offered by Celsius, the determination whether digital assets held on a platform or exchange are property of the debtor’s estate is highly fact-specific, and the bankruptcy courts have not fully addressed or resolved this issue in each of the bankruptcy proceedings mentioned above. 19

 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2022. OVERVIEW GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its thousands of stores and ecommerce platforms. 24 BUSINESS PRIORITIES The initial phase of GameStop's transformation largely occurred over the course of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This period was primarily focused on rebuilding the Company's decaying infrastructure and strengthening GameStop's value proposition, including investing in the Company's enterprise systems, technology capabilities, store leaders and store associates, and product catalog and offerings. GameStop entered a new phase of its transformation during the back half of 2022. As a result, GameStop is focused on three overarching goals: establishing omnichannel retail excellence, achieving profitability, and leveraging brand equity to support growth. We are taking the following steps, with a significant emphasis on cost containment: • Improving margins through operational discipline and increased emphasis on higher margin collectibles and pre-owned product categories; • Ensuring the Company's cost structure is sustainable relative to revenue, including taking steps to optimize our workforce to operate efficiently and nimbly; • Prudently increasing the size of our addressable market by growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality and other categories that represent natural extensions of our business; and • Sustaining a favorable customer experience through seamless in-store and ecommerce platforms and speedy delivery to our customers. In connection with our cost reduction efforts, we expect to see favorable impacts to our selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the quarters to come as we pursue profitability. We also maintain and continue to strengthen our strong balance sheet. In our pursuit of profitability we seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization globally. While we expect our intense focus on expense reductions to yield decreases in SG&A expenses we continue to explore strategic options, which may include further store closings and exiting unprofitable businesses. As a result of these actions, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and other related expenses. By executing on these priorities, we believe we can create a compelling experience for customers and be positioned to invest pragmatically in growth initiatives. In May 2022, we announced the launch of our non-custodial digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive, and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched our NFT marketplace to allow gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Our NFT marketplace enables parties to own their digital assets, which are represented and secured on the blockchain, and allows parties to connect to their own digital asset wallets to enable transactions. In November 2022, we launched the integration of the Immutable X blockchain protocol, which provides access to various Web 3.0 products and NFT gaming assets to our customers. We believe the combination of these efforts to stabilize and optimize our core business are critical to achieve sustained profitability to enable long-term value creation for our stockholders. STORE COUNT INFORMATION The following table presents the number of stores by segment as of the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. January 29, 2022 Openings Disposals January 28, 2023 United States 3,018 — (69) 2,949 Canada 231 — (15) 216 Australia 417 6 (4) 419 Europe 907 2 (80) 829 Total Stores 4,573 8 (168) 4,413 25 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain statement of operations items (in millions) and as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Change Amount Percent of Net Sales Amount Percent of Net Sales $ % Net sales $ 5,927.2 100.0 % $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ (83.5) (1.4) % Cost of sales 4,555.1 76.9 4,662.9 77.6 (107.8) (2.3) Gross profit 1,372.1 23.1 1,347.8 22.4 24.3 1.8 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 1,681.0 28.4 1,709.6 28.4 (28.6) (1.7) Asset impairments 2.7 — 6.7 0.1 (4.0) (59.7) Operating loss (311.6) (5.3) (368.5) (6.1) 56.9 15.4 Interest (income) expense and other, net (9.5) (0.2) 26.9 0.4 (36.4) 135.3 Loss before income taxes (302.1) (5.1) (395.4) (6.6) 93.3 23.6 Income tax expense (benefit) 11.0 0.2 (14.1) (0.2) 25.1 (178.0) Net loss $ (313.1) (5.3) % $ (381.3) (6.3) % $ 68.2 17.9 % Net Sales The following table presents net sales by significant product category: Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Change Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales $ % Hardware and accessories $ 3,140.0 53.0 % $ 3,171.7 52.8 % $ (31.7) (1.0) % Software 1,822.6 30.7 2,014.8 33.5 (192.2) (9.5) Collectibles 964.6 16.3 824.2 13.7 140.4 17.0 Total $ 5,927.2 100.0 % $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ (83.5) (1.4) % The following table presents net sales by reportable segment: Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Change Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales $ % United States $ 4,093.0 69.1 % $ 4,186.5 69.7 % $ (93.5) (2.2) % Canada 344.1 5.8 332.3 5.5 11.8 3.6 Australia 588.7 9.9 591.8 9.8 (3.1) (0.5) Europe 901.4 15.2 900.1 15.0 1.3 0.1 Total $ 5,927.2 100.0 % $ 6,010.7 100.0 % $ (83.5) (1.4) % 26 Net sales decreased $83.5 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Net sales during fiscal 2022 in our Canada and Europe segments increased by 3.6% and 0.1%, respectively, while net sales in our United States and Australia segments decreased by 2.2% and 0.5%, respectively, when compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease in consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, a decline in sales from new software releases as a result of fewer significant title launches in fiscal 2022, and a decline in sales of video game accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of new gaming hardware and an increase in sales of toys and collectibles. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $24.3 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 22.4% in fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to a decrease in freight expense as a result of lower ecommerce volume and added cost optimizations, partially offset by the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses decreased $28.6 million, or 1.7%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and SG&A as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 remained constant at 28.4%. SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, a decrease in marketing expenses, and reduction in labor-related and consulting service costs driven by our focus on cost structure optimization efforts, and the recognition of deferred income related to our partnership with Immutable X Pty Limited ("IMX"). Asset Impairments Asset impairments related to store-level assets decreased $4.0 million, or 59.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recognized $2.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in asset impairment charges related to store-level assets. See   

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 , "Asset Impairments," for additional information related to the impact on our segments. Interest (Income) Expense and Other, Net Interest (income) expense and other, net decreased by $36.4 million, or 135.3%, shifting from net interest expense in fiscal 2021 to net interest income in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to interest income increasing by $13.1 million in fiscal 2022 as a result of higher returns on invested cash, and interest expense decreasing in fiscal 2022 as a result of lower debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we repaid $73.2 million aggregate principal of our then outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes") and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal of our then outstanding 10% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Notes") including a $17.8 million make-whole premium. Income Tax We recognized an income tax expense of $11.0 million representing an effective tax rate of (3.6)% in fiscal 2022, compared to an income tax benefit of $14.1 million representing an effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate of (3.6)% in fiscal 2022 is primarily due to not recognizing benefits on certain current period losses, as well as income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to not recognizing benefits on certain current period losses, the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Australia and New Zealand, incremental tax benefits recognized in association with the CARES Act, as well as income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. 27 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,139.0 $ 1,271.4 Marketable securities 251.6 — Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,390.6 $ 1,271.4 Sources of Liquidity; Uses of Capital Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings from the capital markets, which include our revolving credit facilities. As of January 28, 2023, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1,139.0 million, marketable securities of $251.6 million, and an additional $330.7 million of effective available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and consist primarily of U.S. government bonds and notes, money market funds, cash deposits with commercial banks, and highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 90 days or less. Our marketable securities are also carried at fair value and include investments in certain highly-rated short-term government bonds and notes that mature in less than one year. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. In August 2022, the Company opened investment portfolios consisting of U.S. government treasury notes and bills in an aggregate amount of $250.0 million. As of January 28, 2023, the investment portfolios aggregate balance was $252.6 million, of which $251.6 million are recognized in marketable securities and $1.0 million are recognized in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2021, we sold an aggregate of 34,000,000 shares of our common stock under our at-the market equity offering program (the "ATM Transactions"). We generated $1.67 billion in aggregate net proceeds from sales under the ATM Transactions. The net proceeds generated from sales under the ATM Transactions have been, and are expected to be, used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding our transformation, growth initiatives and product category expansion efforts, capital expenditures and the satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we repaid the remaining $73.2 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2023 Senior Notes. Also, in fiscal 2021, the six separate unsecured term loans held by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, for a total of €40.0 million were extended for five years. As of January 28, 2023, €36.3 million, or $39.5 million, remains outstanding. In November 2021 we entered into a credit agreement for a secured asset-based credit facility comprised of a $500 million revolving line of credit which matures in November 2026 ("2026 Revolver"). As of January 28, 2023, no loan amounts were outstanding under the 2026 Revolver and $119.3 million of standby letters of credit were issued and undrawn under the 2026 Revolver. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14 , "Debt," for additional information. Separate from the 2026 Revolver, we maintain uncommitted facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of January 28, 2023, we had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $14.5 million outside of the 2026 Revolver, and $57.0 million of collateralized cash which is classified as restricted cash in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, uses for our excess cash in low-risk, short-term investments, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance, our commitments and obligations, our capital requirements, limitations imposed under our credit facilities and overall market conditions. 28 Certain vendors have been impacted by volatility in the supply chain financing market. Some of our vendors have requested and may continue to request credit support collateral for our inventory purchase obligations and the levels of such collateral will depend on a variety of factors including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral. Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 2022 2021 Change Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 108.2 $ (434.3) $ 542.5 Cash used in investing activities (222.7) (64.8) (157.9) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (7.9) 1,200.6 (1,208.5) Exchange rate effect on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (1.5) (16.6) 15.1 (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (123.9) $ 684.9 $ (808.8) Operating Activities In fiscal 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities were an inflow of $108.2 million, compared with an outflow of $434.3 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in merchandise inventory levels and collection of $176.0 million in tax refunds, partially offset by the impact of our net loss. The reduction in merchandise inventory was due to improved inventory management, including a more disciplined purchasing strategy, more advantageous product mix ahead of the fiscal 2022 holiday season, and an improvement in supply chain constraints. Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in merchandise inventory levels when compared to prior year to, among other things, support our product category expansion efforts, and to mitigate the full impact of global supply chain issues. Investing activities In fiscal 2022, cash flows used in investing activities were an outflow of $222.7 million compared to an outflow of $64.8 million in fiscal 2021. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities and ongoing technological investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of digital assets and proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to technological investments, and investments in our fulfillment operations. Financing activities In fiscal 2022, cash flows from financing activities were an outflow of $7.9 million compared to an inflow of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to settlement of stock-based awards. Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the sale of shares of our common stock in connection with the ATM transactions for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $136.8 million for withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock, repayment of $73.2 million of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes, and the voluntary early redemption of our outstanding 2023 Senior Notes for an aggregate of $234.2 million (inclusive of a $17.8 million make-whole premium). We also repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our then existing revolving credit facility in 2021. Share Repurchases On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization allowing us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our Class A Common Stock. The authorization has no expiration date. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020. As of January 28, 2023, we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 28, 2023 other than those disclosed 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16 , "Commitments and Contingencies". 29 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 , "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Valuation of Merchandise Inventories Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned gaming systems traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value. A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at January 28, 2023 would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.5 million in fiscal 2022. Customer Liabilities Our PowerUp Rewards ® loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards and discounts. We allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration. The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated amount of points that will never be redeemed, which is a concept known in the retail industry as "breakage." Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer and recognize estimated breakage on gift cards in proportion to historical redemption patterns. The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average retail price per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. We estimate breakage of loyalty points and unredeemed gift cards based on historical redemption rates. The weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual loyalty point redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption values, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, retail price per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average retail price per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue balance through current period revenue by an amount estimated to cover the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average retail value per point redeemed at January 28, 2023, in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.8 million in fiscal 2022. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at January 28, 2023 would have affected net earnings by approximately $11.9 million in fiscal 2022. 30 Income Taxes We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Based on our analysis, we have determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowances increased to $408.5 million as of January 28, 2023, primarily due to cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions. See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $13.2 million as of January 28, 2023. Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS See 

   Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 , "New Accounting Pronouncements," for recent accounting standards and pronouncements. 

  ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk due to foreign currency fluctuations, described more fully below. Foreign Currency Risk We use forward exchange contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. The forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans. We recognized a gain of $7.3 million and a gain of $9.6 million in SG&A expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative instruments for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively. The aggregate fair value of the forward exchange contracts as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was a net liability of $5.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively, as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg , and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of January 28, 2023 would result in a gain of $10.2 million or a loss of $8.4 million in value of the forward exchange contracts. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. 31

Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to goodwill impairments of $627.0 million resulting from our interim goodwill impairment tests performed during the third quarter of fiscal 2012.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment charges. (2) Results for fiscal 2013 include impairments of $18.5 million, of which $7.4 million and $2.1 million were related to certain technology assets and other intangible assets, respectively, as a result of our decision to abandon our investment in Spawn Labs and the remaining $9.0 million was related to property and equipment impairments resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets.  Results for fiscal 2012 include charges related to asset impairments of $53.7 million, of which $44.9 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name and $8.8 million relates to other impairment charges from the evaluations of store property, equipment and other assets. Results for fiscal 2011 include charges related to asset impairments and restructuring charges of $81.2 million, of which $37.8 million relates to the impairment of the Micromania trade name, $22.7 million relates to the impairment of investments in non-core businesses and $20.7 million relates to other impairments, termination benefits and facility closure costs. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, results include impairment charges resulting from our evaluation of store property, equipment and other assets. (3) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from stores operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our Web sites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2014 compares the 52 weeks for the period ended February 1, 2014 to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as a multi-channel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. (4) We have revised the presentation of outstanding checks in our prior period financial statements. Previously, we reduced cash and liabilities when the checks were presented for payment and cleared our bank accounts. As of February 1, 2014, we reduce cash and liabilities when the checks are released for payment.  See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
