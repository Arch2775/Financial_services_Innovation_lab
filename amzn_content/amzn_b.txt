**Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) - Gross Margin Analysis (2020-2022)**

Increase in 2021: Amazon's gross margin saw a significant jump in 2021, reaching 42.0%. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including:
- **Growth of High-Margin Businesses:** Amazon's service segments, such as AWS, advertising, and third-party seller services, generally have higher margins than its retail business. The strong growth of these segments contributed to the overall increase in gross margin.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Amazon's continued focus on optimizing its operations and supply chain may have led to improved efficiency and cost savings, thereby boosting gross margins.
- **Pricing Power:** During this period, Amazon might have enjoyed increased pricing power due to strong consumer demand and limited competition in certain product categories.
Slight Decline in 2022: The gross margin decreased slightly in 2022 to 40.3%. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including:
- **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** Rising inflation and increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and transportation likely put pressure on Amazon's margins.
- **Increased Investment in Fulfillment:** Amazon's continued expansion of its fulfillment network and investment in faster delivery options may have contributed to higher costs and a slight reduction in gross margin.
- **Shifting Sales Mix:** Changes in the mix of products and services sold, with potentially higher growth in lower-margin categories, could also have impacted the overall gross margin.

**Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) - Top 5 Potential Risk Factors:**
