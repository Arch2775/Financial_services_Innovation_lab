ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Effective January 31,
1998, we changed our fiscal year-end financial reporting period to a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Sunday in January. We elected not to restate the previous reporting periods ending December 31. As a result, the first and fourth quarters of
fiscal 1999 (year ended January 31, 1999) are 12- and 14-week periods, respectively, with the remaining quarters being 13-week periods. All four quarters of fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 (year ended January 27, 2002) are 13-week periods. Restatement We conducted a review of
our accounting records and financial statements in response to an inquiry from the SEC. Based on the results of the review, we restated the financial statements and related disclosures for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2002 and for the
fiscal years 2001 and 2000. All information, discussions and comparisons in this Form 10-K reflect the restatement. The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying restated January 28, 2001 and January 30, 2000 consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended January 27, 2002. For additional information on the
restatement, refer to Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We design, develop and market graphics and media communication processors and related software for personal computers, or PCs, workstations and digital entertainment platforms. We
provide an architecturally compatible “top-to-bottom” family of award-winning performance 3D graphics processors and GPUs that set the standard for performance, quality and features for a broad range of desktop PCs, from professional
workstations to low-cost PCs and mobile PCs, from performance laptops to thin-and-light notebooks. Our 3D graphics processors are used for a wide variety of applications, including games, digital image editing, business productivity, the Internet
and industrial design. Our graphics processors are designed to be architecturally compatible backward and forward between generations, giving our original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, customers and end users a low cost of ownership. We have five major product brands: GeForce, nForce, GeForce Go, Quadro and TNT2. The GeForce family represents our desktop
GPUs. We are recognized for developing the world’s first programmable GPUs, the GeForce4 and GeForce3. The GeForce4 and GeForce3 GPUs are designed to deliver the highest performance and cinematic-quality for interactive entertainment, digital
image editing and digital video playback applications through the use of highly-programmable processing elements. The nForce and Xbox IGP and MCP are the industry’s first highly-integrated platform processors to incorporate a comprehensive set
of multimedia capabilities, such as 2D, 3D, DVD, HDTV, Dolby Digital audio playback and fast broadband and networking communications. Our mobile product family, which consists of the GeForce 4 and GeForce2 Go GPUs, are designed to deliver desktop
graphics performance and features for multiple laptop configurations from desktop replacements to thin-and-lights. The Quadro family of workstation GPUs consists of an extensive range of products for the high-end, mid-range, entry level,
multi-display 2D and digital content creation markets. The NVIDIA TNT2 family of graphics processors delivers high performance 3D and 2D graphics at affordable prices, making them the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of applications for
both consumer and commercial use. Our entire product family provides superior processing and rendering power at competitive prices and is architected to deliver the maximum performance from industry standards such as Microsoft’s Direct3D API
and SGI’s OpenGL API on Windows operating systems and Linux platforms. Currently, all of our product sales and our
arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars. We have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Since the PC market is our core business, our business
would suffer if for any reason our graphics processors do not achieve widespread acceptance in the PC market. 15 A majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers and sales are highly
concentrated. We sell graphics processors to add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, primarily ASUSteK, and CEMs including Celestica, Mitac, Micro-Star, SCI and VisionTek. These manufacturers incorporate our processors in the boards they sell to
PC OEMs, retail outlets and systems integrators. The average selling prices for our products, as well as our customers’ products, vary by distribution channel. Our three largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of revenues for fiscal
2002. Sales to Edom accounted for 20%, sales to Micro-Star accounted for 14% and sales to Atlantic accounted for 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2002. For fiscal 2001, sales to Edom accounted for 25% and sales to Celestica accounted for 11% of
total revenue. For fiscal 2000, sales to Creative accounted for 17%, sales to Edom and sales to Diamond, Inc. each accounted for 15% and sales to ASUSteK accounted for 10% of total revenue. Although we have major customers, our end customers include
Acer, Apple, Compaq, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu-Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, Micron, NEC, Packard Bell, SGI and Sony. As markets
for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that product life cycles in the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, average selling prices and gross margins
are expected to decline as each product matures. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year for the high end, typically based on spring and fall
design cycles. In order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins, our existing and new products must achieve competitive performance levels to be designed into new system configurations and must be produced at low costs, in sufficient
volumes and on a timely basis, especially with respect to our new products. We currently utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, to produce semiconductor wafers and we utilize independent contractors to perform assembly, testing
and packaging. Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term agreements. As a
result, we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business. In addition,
cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated
growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major OEMs. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A
reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. Product returns or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income, which could harm our
business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs, revenue recognition, sales returns, allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have a relatively short operating history on which to base judgments and
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical
accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. 16 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is
reasonably assured. Our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of sales and related cost of sales until the distributors and representatives resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue
for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. We
also record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on historical return rates and analysis. For all sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed
to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize
revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to
make required payments. Our reserve consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results. Inventory We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management,
additional inventory write-downs may be required which could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we will have higher gross margins when products are sold. Tax Valuation Allowance We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amount, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase net income in the
period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made. 17 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 27, 2002 Year Ended January 28, 2001 Year Ended January 30, 2000 (As restated –see Note 2) (As restated –see Note 2) Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 62.1 62.9 62.1 Gross profit 37.9 37.1 37.9 Operating expenses: Research and development 11.2 11.7 12.5 Sales, general and administrative 7.1 8.0 9.7 Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 0.9 — — Acquisition related charges 0.7 — — Discontinued use of property 0.3 — — Total operating expenses 20.2 19.7 22.2 Operating income 17.7 17.4 15.7 Interest and other income, net 0.8 2.3 0.5 Income before income tax expense 18.5 19.7 16.2 Income tax expense 5.5 6.3 5.2 Net income 13.0 % 13.4 % 11.0 % Fiscal Years Ended January 27, 2002, January 28, 2001, and January 30, 2000 Revenue Revenue was $1.37 billion in fiscal 2002, $735.3 million in fiscal 2001, and $374.5 million in fiscal 2000. Product revenues increased by 86% from fiscal 2001 to 2002, and 96% from fiscal 2000 to 2001. The growth was
primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by the strong demand for our products in the PC, workstation and mobile laptop markets and the introduction of our graphics processors into the game console market. Revenue
from sales outside of the United States accounted for 82% and 89% of total revenue for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Geographic sales are based on bill-to address and this decrease in revenue from sales outside of the United States is
primarily attributable to sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the Microsoft Xbox product billed to Microsoft in the United States. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location
to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers located in the United States. Although we achieved substantial growth in product
revenue from fiscal 2001 to 2002 and fiscal 2000 to 2001, we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products. The
declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost
of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from contract manufacturers (including assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such
purchases), final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross profit margin can vary in any period 18 depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold. Our gross profit margins were 37.9%, 37.1% and 37.9% in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit increased 90% from fiscal
2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin Xbox graphics and media communication processors. Gross
profit increased 92% from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to significant increases in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by declining profit margins in our older product
families. Although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, we do not expect to sustain these rates of growth in future periods. Operating Expenses Research and
Development .    Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and development expenses increased by
$67.9 million, or 79%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $31.9 million increase related to additional personnel, including certain employees hired from 3dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below,
a $13.5 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $11.7 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.8 million increase in
facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other expenses during the year. Research and development expenses increased by $39.1 million, or 83%, from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to the addition of personnel and
related engineering costs to support our next generation products, such as depreciation charges incurred on capital expenditures and software license and maintenance fees. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future
due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and
these investments may be independent of our level of revenues. Sales, General and
Administrative .    Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting
expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $38.5 million, or 66%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $21.5 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $6.2 million increase in tradeshow and
product launch costs, and a $10.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities, American Red Cross donation associated with the events of
September 11, 2001, and travel and entertainment expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.4 million, or 62%, from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to costs associated with additional personnel, commissions on sales of
the NVIDIA TNT2 and GeForce families of graphic processors and bonuses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to
increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and our sales. General and administrative expenses are also likely to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and to be affected by legal and
accounting expenses incurred in connection with our recent internal accounting review. Discontinued Use of Property Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa
Clara, California. Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs
related to the preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. 19 Amortization of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and intangible assets from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The
initial allocation of the purchase price was (a) $3.0 million to workforce in place, amortized over two years; (b) $11.3 million to patents and trademarks, amortized over five years; and (c) $57.4 million to goodwill, amortized over five years.
Additional consideration is potentially payable to 3dfx, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” amounts allocated to workforce will be reclassified into goodwill and all goodwill will no longer be amortized beginning fiscal
year 2003. These assets will be assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis. Acquisition Related Charges Acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets of 3dfx. These charges
primarily consisted of bonuses for former 3dfx employees. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense primarily
consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt. Interest income increased $6.4 million from fiscal 2001 to 2002 due to higher average cash balances as a result of a $200.0 million advance
received from Microsoft in connection with our agreement with Microsoft and the receipt of $387.4 million from our 4¾% convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings, which both closed in October 2000. Interest expense increased in
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated notes in October 2000. Income Taxes We had income tax expense of $75.8 million, $46.3 million and $19.4 million in fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000 respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were 30.0% in fiscal 2002, 32.0% in fiscal 2001 and 32.2% in fiscal 2000. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased foreign income, which is taxed
at rates lower than the statutory rates in the United States. Amortization of Stock-Based Compensation With respect to stock options granted to employees, we recorded deferred compensation of $4.3 million in 1997 and
$361,000 in the one month ended January 31, 1998. These amounts were amortized over the vesting period of the individual options, generally four years. We amortized approximately $6,000 in fiscal 2002, $112,000 in fiscal 2001 and $662,000 in fiscal
2000. Deferred compensation was fully amortized in fiscal 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 27, 2002, we had $791.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $117.1 million from the end of fiscal
2001. We historically have held our cash balances in cash or cash equivalents, such as money market funds. In August 2001, we began to invest in marketable securities. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several
financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and limits on our portfolio duration. 20 Operating activities generated cash of $160.8 million, $267.9 million and $15.9 million during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The $267.9 million in fiscal 2001 includes the $200.0 million advance from Microsoft. The decrease from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 was due to the draw down of the $200.0 million advance from Microsoft,
offset by the increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Income tax benefit derived from the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with employees’ exercise of
stock options totaled $88.9 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $63.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 was due to a substantial increase in net income, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our
accounts receivable are highly concentrated. At January 27, 2002, Micro-Star and Edom accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of accounts receivable, respectively. We may be required to write off bad debts in the future, which could harm our
business. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of the purchase of certain assets from various businesses,
investments in marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements for our new facility. We incurred acquisition costs of $64.1 million during fiscal 2002, primarily due to purchase of assets from 3dfx. There
were no significant asset purchase transactions in the prior years. We purchased marketable securities totaling approximately $472.9 million during fiscal 2002. We incurred $97.0 million, $36.3 million and $11.6 million in capital expenditures
in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily attributable to our new facility as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development. We expect capital expenditures to increase as we
further expand research and development initiatives and as our employee base grows. The timing and amount of future capital expenditures will depend primarily on our future growth. We expect to spend approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million for
capital expenditures in fiscal 2003, primarily for software licenses, emulation equipment, purchase of computer and engineering workstations, future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation, and tenant and leasehold
improvements in our new headquarters facility. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets. In April 2000, we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in Santa Clara, California. Our new complex comprises four buildings, representing approximately 500,000 total square feet. The first phase of two
buildings consisting of approximately 250,000 square feet was completed in June 2001, and the second phase of one building consisting of approximately 125,000 square feet was completed in July 2001. Restricted cash deposits of $17.5 million were
released upon completion of the first and second phases. The last phase consisting of approximately 125,000 square feet was completed in February 2002. The $7.0 million in restricted cash relating to letters of credit in place for the developer of
the new facility is expected to be released in May 2002. The leases expire in 2012 and include two seven-year renewals at our option. The future minimum lease payments under these operating leases total approximately $224.3 million over the terms of
the leases. Financing activities provided cash of $99.1 million during fiscal 2002 compared to $405.6 million in fiscal 2001
and $7.0 million in fiscal 2000. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed, under certain terms and conditions, to develop and sell processors for use in the Xbox video game console. In April 2000, Microsoft
paid us $200.0 million under the agreement as an advance against processor purchases. This advance has been fully utilized due to purchases made by Microsoft through the quarter ended April 28, 2002 and Microsoft is currently paying in advance for
processor chipsets sold to it. We have been engaged with Microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the Xbox chipset sold to them by NVIDIA. These discussions and our agreement with Microsoft contemplated use of a third party to
resolve matters and on April 23, 2002 Microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration. Microsoft has requested that the arbitration panel require that we supply chipsets in whatever quantities are ordered by Microsoft. Microsoft has also
asked for damages for alleged violations of the agreement and requested that the arbitration panel reduce chipset prices paid by Microsoft. We do not believe we have a requirements obligation to Microsoft and we plan to submit our position to the
arbitration panel shortly. For sales of the Xbox media communication processor, we have deferred revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the price being paid by Microsoft and the price Microsoft claims it should be paying. This amount
was approximately $13.2 million as of January 27, 2002, the end of our fiscal 2002. We expect that we will continue to defer such amount on future sales of this processor until resolution of the matter. 21 Common Stock and Convertible Subordinated Note Offering In October 2000, we sold 2,800,000 shares of our common stock and $300.0 million of convertible subordinated notes due October 15, 2007 in a public
offering. Proceeds from the offering were approximately $387.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the notes. Interest on the convertible subordinated notes accrues at the rate of 4 3 / 4 % per annum and is payable
semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2001. The convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any
time prior to the close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $46.36 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 3dfx Asset Purchase On April 18, 2001, we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0
million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000, between us and 3dfx. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, following the closing, we are to pay 3dfx additional consideration in the form of stock equal to
two million shares of NVIDIA common stock, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions. If the debts and liabilities of 3dfx can be satisfied for less than $25.0 million and in accordance with the provisions as set forth in the agreement, under
some circumstances, 3dfx could receive a post-closing advance from us of up to $25.0 million and this advance would reduce the number of shares of NVIDIA common stock potentially payable to 3dfx by up to one million shares. In the event 3dfx cannot
satisfy all of its obligations for $25.0 million, NVIDIA will not be obligated to pay any additional consideration. At this time, 3dfx has not satisfied all terms and conditions necessary to receive any contingent consideration. Consequently,
due to the possibility of contingent consideration, the components of the final purchase price could differ from those presented in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The transaction is accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. As a result, this purchase transaction has impacted our working capital in fiscal year 2002 and may have further impact if the additional conditions are met by 3dfx. Contractual Cash Obligations The following summarizes our
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 27, 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Interest on note obligation (1) $ 81,938 $ 14,250 $ 28,500 $ 28,500 $ 10,688 3dfx post-closing advance (2) 25,000 25,000 — — — Interest on capital lease obligations 1,118 700 418 — — Operating leases 234,797 20,772 43,486 44,866 125,673 Purchase obligations (3) 540,950 540,950 — — — Royalty and maintenance commitments 3,368 1,509 1,609 250 — Other long term obligations 975 325 650 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 888,146 $ 603,506 $ 74,663 $ 73,616 $ 136,361 (1) Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾%. The amount of interest obligation assumes that the notes are held until maturity and not
redeemed or converted into 22 shares of common stock at an earlier date. The convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder at
any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date. As such, actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower. (2) If the debts and liabilities of 3dfx cannot be satisfied, under some circumstances, 3dfx could receive a post-closing advance from us of up to $25.0 million and this advance
would reduce the number of shares of common stock potentially payable to 3dfx by up to one million shares. (3) Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments at January 27, 2002. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We
believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise
additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not
presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors which could affect our cash used or
generated from operations and as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: • decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; • inability to successfully develop and produce in volume our next-generation products; • competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and • new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see “Business Risk—Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities
analysts or investors our stock price could decline.” Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading “New Accounting
Pronouncements,” which information is hereby incorporated by reference.   

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt
securities of corporations, municipalities and the U.S. Government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise
in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may
suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates; however, we reduce our interest rate risk by investing cash primarily in instruments with short maturities. As of January 27,
2002, a sensitivity analysis was performed on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. Parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/-50 basis points would result in 23 changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $2.8 million. However, because our debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized
unless such securities are sold. The average holding periods until maturity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately 10 and 591 days, respectively. The principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates for our
investment portfolio were $340.2 million and 1.8% for cash equivalents, and $458.4 million and 4.6% for marketable securities as of January 27, 2002. Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾% and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations. Exchange Rate Risk We consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities,
although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. Business Risks In addition to the risks discussed in “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” our business is subject to the risks set forth below. Risks Related to Our Operations Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or
investors our stock price could decline. Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our
operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be
below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of
factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations. Factors that have affected our results of
operations in the past, and could affect our results of operations in the future, include the following: • demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; • the successful development and volume production of next-generation products; • new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors; • our ability to introduce new products in accordance with OEM design requirements and design cycles; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products; • fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields; • declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the U.S. and international economies; • competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; 24 • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders; • the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship; • seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market; • substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism or other cause; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory devices; • our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products; • legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits; • bad debt write-offs; • costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products; • unexpected inventory write-downs; and • introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed, and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. Therefore, we have limited ability
to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed
in the short term, and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall. Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term agreements. As
a result, we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business. In addition,
cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build memory and component inventories during periods of
anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major OEMs. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast
product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. We may be required to
reduce prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in
research and development or sales and marketing efforts, our business could suffer. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition,
the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year. We need to
develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed. Our business depends to a significant
extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for the 3D graphics market. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based
on spring and fall design cycles. 25 Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system
configurations. This requires that we do the following: • anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand; • incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of PC OEMs, CEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers; • price our products competitively; and • introduce the products to the market within the limited window for PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new
product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following: • proper new product definition; • timely completion and introduction of new product designs; • the ability of TSMC and any additional third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner; • the quality of any new products; • differentiation of new products from those of our competitors; • market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products; and • availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products. Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes
has in the past resulted in initial yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by PC OEMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of 3D graphics. In addition, we may
not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the PC OEMs’ design cycles and market demand. We have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our
failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3D graphics products would harm our business. Our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business. As
markets for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices
and gross margins for our 3D graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices
and gross margins. In order for our 3D graphics processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our 3D graphics processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete
the designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion any new products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any new products we
develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity of our products and
the manufacturing process for products increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development, introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may
experience difficulties related to the production of 26 current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed. In addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition
risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced margins, and reduced demand for products or loss
of market share. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our 3D graphics products non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory, any of which would harm our business. We could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects. Products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We have in the
past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or lost revenue to correct any new defects in the future. Errors in new products or releases after commencement of
commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. Our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution. As a result, our products may
contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. If these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair
or replace the affected products in the field. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results. The production and distribution of defective products could harm our business. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products would reduce our gross margins. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is
proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify
process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us
and the manufacturer. The risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our manufacturers, increasing
the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an
increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or
maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing
defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, our business could suffer. Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively. Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have
greater risk of initial yield problems. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process
technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We currently use .15-micron process technology for the GeForce4, Quadro4, GeForce3, Quadro DCC, Xbox and nForce families of graphics processors, and we believe that the transition of our
products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive 27 position. We are currently evaluating and qualifying the .13 micron process technology for products that are estimated to begin commercial shipment later in our fiscal 2003. Other companies in
the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. We may experience similar difficulties and the
corresponding negative effects. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. We may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process technologies
successfully or on a timely basis. We may be unable to manage our growth and, as a result, may be unable to successfully
implement our strategy. Our rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our
managerial, operational and financial resources. As of January 27, 2002, we had 1,123 employees as compared to 796 employees as of January 28, 2001. We expect that the number of our employees will increase substantially over the next 12 months. Our
future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis, as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls. Further, we
will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties. Our systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution
necessary to successfully implement our strategy. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could
harm our business. Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key
employees. None of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement, and so our relationships with these officers and employees are at will. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss
of the services of any of our executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire,
train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business. Our reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly, testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the United
States, including the following: • unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; • delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; • longer payment cycles; • imposition of additional taxes and penalties; • the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and • other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, which may delay the shipment of our products. We also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are
or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and
products more likely. Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S.
dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. 28 Failure in operation or future enhancement or implementation of our enterprise resource
planning system could harm our operations. We are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems
to conduct our business. System failure or malfunction may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process transactions. Our results of operations and financial position could be harmed if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect
to system operations or future implementations. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our
agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws
contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: • the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval; • the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; • a classified board of directors; and • advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for
use in a product under development by Microsoft. In the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft has first and last rights of
refusal to purchase the stock. The provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of our company. We may not
be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products. In the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products, services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or
help expand our distribution channels. For any previous or future acquisition or investment, the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and, ultimately, could impair our ability to sell our products: • difficulty in combining the technology, operations or workforce of the acquired business; • disruption of our ongoing businesses; • difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction; • difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and • possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel. In addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and
common stock. If the consideration is paid with our common stock, existing stockholders would be further diluted. Risks Related to Our Partners We are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. We primarily sell our products to
add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs, which incorporate graphics products in the boards they sell to PC OEMs and system builders. Sales to add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs are primarily dependent on achieving design
wins with leading PC OEMs. The number of add-in board 29 and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and leading PC OEMs is limited. We expect that a small number of add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs directly, and a small number of PC OEMs
indirectly, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our business could be harmed by the loss of business from PC OEMs or add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs. In
addition, revenue from add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and PC OEMs that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or may not reach or exceed
historical levels in any future period. Our business may be harmed by instability in Asia due to the concentration of customers
who are located or have substantial operations in Asia, including Taiwan. The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan have in the past experienced strained relations. A worsening of these relationships or the development of hostilities between
the two could result in disruptions in Taiwan and possibly other areas of Asia, which could harm our business. In addition, if relations between the U.S. and The People’s Republic of China become strained, our business could be harmed. While we
believe political instability in Asia has not harmed our business, because of our reliance on companies with operations in Asia, continued economic and political instability in Asia might harm it. We rely on third-party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to
develop these products. In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party
software development tools. While we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have experienced delays in the introduction of
products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features
and greater functionality from 3D graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet
consumer demands, our business could suffer. We may not be successful in producing the processors in volumes required for
Microsoft’s Xbox and, even if successful we may not achieve profit margins consistent with management’s expectations. Our Xbox IGP and MCP are new and complicated processors. Both processors have increased in complexity and features from what was contemplated at the time we entered into the agreement with Microsoft. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to produce these processors in the volume necessary and within the required time frames or that the payments for these processors will be consistent with profit margins achieved on our other products. Finally, there can be no assurance that
the Xbox program will achieve long term commercial success, given the high level of competition in the game console market. If any of these risks occur, our business may be harmed. We may not prevail in the arbitration with Microsoft over pricing of the Xbox chipset and even if we do prevail, there is no assurance that our business will not be materially
harmed. We have been engaged with Microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the Xbox chipset. These
discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on April 23, 2002 Microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration. Microsoft has requested that the arbitration panel require that we supply chipsets in
whatever quantities are ordered by Microsoft. Microsoft has also asked for damages for alleged violations of the agreement and requested that the arbitration panel reduce chipset prices paid by Microsoft. We do not believe we have a requirements
obligation to Microsoft and we plan to submit our position to the arbitration panel shortly. For sales of the Xbox media communication processor, we have deferred revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the price being paid by Microsoft
and the price Microsoft claims it should be paying. This amount was approximately $13.2 million as of January 27, 2002, the end of our fiscal 30 2002. We expect that we will continue to defer such amount on future sales of this processor until resolution of the matter. The arbitration will be conducted in New York by a panel under the
rules of the American Arbitration Association. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the arbitration or continue to
supply graphics and other processors for the Xbox. If we do not prevail, we may (i) be compelled to deliver Xbox processors at reduced pricing, resulting in reduced gross margins, or a loss, on such processors; (ii) be required to reduce production
and delivery of other products in order to satisfy obligations to Microsoft; (iii) be required to pay significant damages to Microsoft; or (iv) be subject to other remedies that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we do
prevail, there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed. We depend on foreign foundries and
independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our business. We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers manufactured with
state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We utilize TSMC to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent contractors to perform assembly, testing and packaging. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of
their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our
near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and TSMC has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC fabricates wafers for other companies,
including certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing
partner could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product. We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC and any other
manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. Because of our reliance on TSMC, our
business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, or if relations between the U.S. and The People’s Republic of China are
strained due to foreign relations events. Furthermore, any substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could harm our
business. We are dependent primarily on TSMC and we expect in the future to continue to be dependent upon third-party
manufacturers to do the following: • produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields; • deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis; and • allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of TSMC. Although our products are designed using TSMC’s process design rules, TSMC may be
unable to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and/or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, TSMC may not continue to devote resources to the production of our products, or to advance the
process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based. Any difficulties like these would harm our business. We are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of our products. Our graphics
processors are assembled and tested by Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., ChipPAC Incorporated and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering. We do not have long-term agreements with 31 any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not directly control product delivery schedules
or product quality. Any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business. Due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and
testers, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components. Any delays in delivery of our products could harm our
business. Risks Related to Our Competition The 3D graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete. The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We
believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing
capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3D graphics
processors, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. We may be unable to compete successfully in the emerging PC graphics market. Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include the following: • suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and
Via Technologies, Inc. or Via; • suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally developed graphics chips, such as ATI Technologies Inc. and Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd.; • suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate 2D or 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Trident Microsystems,
Inc. and the joint venture of a division of SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3 Incorporated) and Via Technologies; and • companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including 3Dlabs and ATI Technologies Inc. If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor market, we may face competition
from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. We may not successfully compete with Intel in the integrated chipset market. It is projected by analysts that integrated chipsets are likely to become a majority share of the PC graphics market. We have recently introduced and begun shipment of the
nForce platform processor, an integrated 3D graphics chipset. The nForce platform processor is initially designed to support microprocessors produced by AMD. Intel is the dominant supplier of integrated 3D graphics chipsets and has commenced
production of an integrated chipset for its Pentium 4 microprocessor. Intel has significantly greater resources than we do, and the nForce platform processor, or other 3D graphics products that we may introduce, may not compete effectively against
Intel’s current chipset products or its future products, either in terms of price or performance. In addition, due to the
widespread industry acceptance of Intel’s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture, including its accelerated graphics port architecture, or AGP, Intel exercises significant influence over the PC industry and over companies
developing products for such architecture. Any significant 32 modifications by Intel to the AGP, the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects of the PC microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our technology, which
would harm our business. In addition, any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm our business. In addition to its influence over the PC architecture, Intel has asserted intellectual property rights in various PC architecture interfaces. For example, as a result of patents held by Intel, it has asserted that
companies wishing to develop a chipset compatible with the Pentium 4 microprocessor or similar microprocessors obtain a license from Intel. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product
offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. In
September 2001 Intel filed a patent infringement suit against Via with respect to a Via chipset for the Pentium 4. We do not have a license from Intel for such a chipset. We expect Intel to continue to do the following: • invest heavily in research and development and continue development of integrated 3D graphics products; • maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of PC microprocessors; • use its intellectual property position with respect to the PC microprocessor and architecture to defend its position in 3D graphics, including the filing of patent infringement
suits against competitors; • follow business practices in its PC business, which strongly encourage use of Intel integrated chipsets; • increasingly dominate the PC platform; and • promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to engender brand loyalty among PC users. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. Our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the 3D graphics processors for hardware components
or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, generally based on
spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations. Our
failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a PC OEM’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product
feature, which also could harm our business. Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify
and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including Intel and
Microsoft. This would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of
time, our ability to achieve design wins could suffer. 33 Risks Related to Financial and Market Conditions We are dependent on the PC market and the slowdown in its growth may have a negative impact on our business. During fiscal 2002, we derived most of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop PC market, from professional workstations to
low-cost PCs. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop PC market in the next several years. The PC market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, frequent new product introductions and significant price competition. These factors result in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product. A reduction in sales of PCs, or
a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, could reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with
excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory
has been absorbed. It is possible that the recent slowing of the economy in the U.S. and international regions, which has negatively impacted some PC manufacturers and led to some reductions in the demand for PCs, could lead to reductions in
inventory purchases by PC manufacturers. Any reduction in the demand for PCs generally, or for a particular product that incorporates our 3D graphic processors, could harm our business. The acceptance of next generation products in business PC 3D graphics may not continue to develop. Our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3D graphics for business PC applications. The market for performance 3D graphics on business PCs has only recently begun
to emerge and is dependent on the future development of, and substantial end-user and OEM demand for, 3D graphics functionality. As a result, the market for business PC 3D graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate
sufficient to support our business. The development of the market for performance 3D graphics in business PCs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a large number of business PC software applications that support or take
advantage of performance 3D graphics capabilities. Currently, there are only a limited number of software applications like this, most of which are games, and a broader base of software applications may not develop in the near term or at all.
Consequently, a broad market for full function performance 3D graphics on business PCs may not develop. Our business prospects will suffer if the market for business PC 3D graphics fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected. Our 3D graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the PC market. Our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our 3D graphics processors for high performance 3D graphics in PC applications. The
market for 3D graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic random memory devices
pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such
market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition. Since the PC market is our core business, our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future 3D graphics processors do not continue to achieve
widespread acceptance in the PC market. If we are unable to complete the timely development of or successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the PC market, our business would be harmed. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business. The semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the following factors: • rapid technological change; • cyclical market patterns; 34 • significant average selling price erosion; • fluctuating inventory levels; • alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints; and • variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. In addition, the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times, characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions. Our stock price may continue to experience significant short-term fluctuations. The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are
non-company specific, such as the decline in the U.S. economy, or due to a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities
analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing company.
Since February 2002, multiple securities class action lawsuits and several derivative suits have been filed against us. We expect that this litigation, whether or not resolved favorably, may result in substantial cost and a diversion of
management’s attention and resources, which could harm our revenues and earnings. Any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. See “Legal Proceedings” and Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading “Litigation” for a description of this litigation. We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates. For additional information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see  

 Item 7a “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate
Risk.” Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation and Government Action Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has
resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. The 3D graphics market in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive
intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number
of issued hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in our markets intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase. If infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the
claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights. However, licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could
cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products, which could reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for
infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products. 35 Litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in
significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We are currently subject to
patent infringement suits, and we may be subject to patent infringement suits brought by other parties in the future. We do not believe that current suits will have a material impact on our business or financial condition. However, these lawsuits
and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages. Our ability to
compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on a
combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In
addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially
equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for
incorporation in our graphics processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross-licensing of technology by us or payment of other
consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. Future actions by the SEC or other governmental or regulatory agencies and resolution of related litigation arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters could harm our business. The SEC staff informed us in January 2002 that it had concerns relating to certain accounting matters and that the SEC along with the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California had authorized a private investigation into such matters. In accordance with the suggestion and advice of the SEC staff, we launched a review of these matters. On April 29, 2002, we
announced that the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors had, with assistance from the law firm of Cooley Godward LLP and forensic auditors from the firm of KPMG LLP, concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate our
financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002. The Audit Committee has worked in cooperation with the SEC and has provided the SEC with extensive information and the conclusions of the review. Further actions
by the SEC or other governmental or regulatory agencies with respect to us or our personnel arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters may take significant time, may be expensive and may divert management’s
attention from other business concerns and harm our business. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against us following our announcement on February 14, 2002 of the internal review. The defense of, and any resolution of such lawsuits
may require significant expenditures and materially impact our business and results of operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Our Company NVIDIA Corporation is a market leader in digital media processor technology, dedicated to creating products that enhance the interactive experience on consumer and professional computing platforms. We design, develop and market graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications processors, or MCPs, ultra-low power media processors, or UMPs, and related software. Our products are integral to a wide variety of visual computing platforms, including enterprise personal computers, or PCs, consumer PCs, professional workstations, notebook PCs, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, game consoles and digital media centers. We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our mission is to be the most important visual computing company in 
the world. Recent Developments Convertible Subordinated Debenture Redemption On October 24, 2003, we redeemed our 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures, or the Notes, due 2007. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of notes that we repurchased during the three months ended October 26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a one-time charge of approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of unamortized issuance costs. SEC Investigation On September 11, 2003, we announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, had concluded its investigation of us and that we have reached a final agreement with the SEC resolving an investigation undertaken by the SEC’s staff. Under the terms of the agreement, NVIDIA, without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing, agreed to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain non-fraud financial reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions. There is no requirement to pay any fines or penalties. Acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. On August 19, 2003, we completed the acquisition of MediaQ, Inc., or MediaQ, a leading provider of graphics and multimedia technology for wireless mobile devices, for an aggregate purchase price that consisted of cash consideration of approximately $71.3 million, including $1.3 million of direct acquisition costs. With the integration of MediaQ, w e see an opportunity to leverage NVIDIA’s resources and expertise in digital media processing to offer innovative products and thereby increase our revenues by entering into the multimedia handset market. Microsoft Xbox On August 14, 2003, Microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of Xbox processors to Microsoft is uncertain, but we do not believe that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least 18 – 24 months. Revenue from Microsoft during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 accounted for 15%, 23% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenue. 12 Future Objectives and Challenges Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, or PCI-Express PCI Express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking. The transition to PCI Express, which is extremely complex, is central to our GPU and MCP objectives this year. We intend to lead this transition using a PCI Express high-speed interconnect, or HSI. HSI is a complex piece of networking technology that performs high-speed bi-directional interconnect protocol conversion. Using HSI, we expect to transform some of our GPUs into PCI Express compatible GPUs. With our PCI Express compatible GPUs, we expect that our partners will be able to launch PCI Express compatible solutions in April 2004. During fiscal 2005, we expect to launch and be in full production with a top-to-bottom product line of next generation PCI 
Express GPUs based on our brand new NV4X architecture. Gross Margin Improvement We remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins. With the scale of our business, we believe driving gross margins to our historical levels can result in earnings improvements. nForce3 Just as nForce2 was the driver for our platform processor business growth in fiscal 2004, nForce3 has the potential to achieve similar results for fiscal 2005. Our MCP objective is to innovate in all areas of features, performance and compatibility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we intend to launch our next nForce3, which is expected to be the first single-chip MCP to offer gigabit Ethernet, dual independent serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or ATA, controllers, industry leading Redundant Array of Independent Disks, or RAID, features and hardware security processing. Handsets Our handheld objective is to drive the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products that leverage NVIDIA’s expertise, resources, and investments in digital media processing. The first quarter of fiscal 2005 will mark the beginning of a series of introductions of exciting new ultra-low power media processors for handsets. Over the next several years, digital media processing technologies are expected to play a critical role in the cell phone industry. Cell phones that take digital pictures will eclipse shipments of digital cameras. With the UMPs on our roadmap, future cell phones will be able to receive television programs, record digital video like a camcorder, enable video phone calls, and be your portable game player. .11 Micron Process On February 24, 2004, we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select up-coming GPUs at TSMC's 0.11 um (micron) process technology. We will combine TSMC's 0.11 micron process with our own engineering designs, to deliver high-performance and low-power consumption in a graphics processor. TSMC's 0.11 micron process technology is fundamentally a photolithographic shrink of its industry-leading 0.13 micron process. Though actual results are design-dependent, TSMC's 0.11 micron high-performance process also includes transistor enhancements that improve speed and reduce power consumption relative to its 0.13 micron technology. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes, stock-based compensation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
 reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. 13 We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. For all sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized.  Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets.  We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products) and, as such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor.  Unclaimed rebates, which hist
orically have not been significant, are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate.  Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale. Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs, which we also account for in accordance with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs, distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current credit insurance agreement expires on 
December 31, 2004. As of January 25, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $2.3 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $219.5 million. Of the $219.5 million, $39.7 million was covered by credit insurance and $3.0 million was covered by letters of credit. As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 1% and 2%. As of January 25, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 1% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at 2% of our gross accounts receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 25, 2004 would have been approximately $4.4 million, rather than the actual b
alance of $2.3 million. 14 Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are sold. No significant sales of such products have occurred to date. Valuation of Long-lived Assets We review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We utilize a two-step approach to testing long-lived assets for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator is present, the second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Our review requires the use of judgment and estimates. No such impairment charges have occurred to date. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. Goodwill We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings due 
to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests. Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation all
owance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the United States, or U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment
, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly. 15 As of January 25, 2004, we had a valuation allowance of $182.7 million. Of the total valuation allowance, $117.0 million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if and when realization is sustained, will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders' equity. Of the remaining valuation allowance at January 25, 2004, $21.4 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes; and $44.3 million relates to certain
 state deferred tax assets that management determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized. Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 25, January 26, January 27, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenue 71.0 69.5 62.1 Cost of revenue related to stock option exchange -- 0.3 -- Gross profit 29.0 30.2 37.9 Operating expenses: Research and development 14.8 11.8 11.3 Sales, general and administrative 9.1 7.9 7.2 In-process research and development 0.2 -- -- Stock option exchange -- 2.9 -- Amortization of goodwill 0.0 0.0 0.7 Acquisition related charges 0.0 0.0 0.7 Discontinued use of property 0.0 0.0 0.3 Total operating expenses 24.1 22.6 20.2 Income from operations 4.9 7.6 17.7 Interest and other income, net 0.5 0.3 0.8 Convertible debenture redemption expense (0.7) 0.0 0.0 Income before income tax expense 4.7 7.9 18.5 Income tax expense 0.6 3.1 5.5 Net income 4.1 % 4.8 % 13.0 % 16 Fiscal Years Ended January 25, 2004, January 26, 2003, and January 27, 2002 Revenue Revenue was $1.82 billion in fiscal 2004, $1.91 billion in fiscal 2003, and $1.37 billion in fiscal 2002, which represented a decrease of 5% from fiscal 2003 to 2004 and an increase of 39% from fiscal 2002 to 2003. The revenue decrease from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of Xbox processors to Microsoft, offset by growth in our GPU, MCP and UMP products. The revenue growth from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of significant sales of Xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our GPU and MCP products. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 75%, 68% and 82% of total revenue for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which are billed to Microsoft in the United States. The decrease in the percentage of revenue from sal
es to customers outside of the United States for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to increased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product. Sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 45% of revenues for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 23% of revenues. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of revenues for fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 9% of revenues. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of revenues for fiscal 2002. In future periods, our revenue may be affected by demand for and market acceptance of our products and/or our customers’ products, our ability to successfully develop and produce our products in volume production, competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices, and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors (including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such purchases), final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 29%, 30% and 38% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our new generation of GeForce FX products. Our GeForce FX products generally have experienced lower gross margins than previous GeForce products. This decrease was offset by an increase in gross margins on sales of Xbox processors in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003, which resulted from the pricing settlement with Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003. Gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to a shift in mix of product sales that included more sales of Xbox processors which, at that time, generally had lower margins than our other pro
ducts. In addition, the decrease was due to an inventory write-down of approximately $21.0 million related to certain Xbox processors and nForce platform processors during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and the stock option exchange expense of $6.2 million that was charged to cost of revenue related to manufacturing personnel during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In the future, we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand and market acceptance of our products and/or our customers’ products could also negatively impact our gross margins. We do not expect past results to be indicative of future periods. We remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins. We expect improvement in our gross margins and believe our gross margins can be 30% or more. Operating Expenses Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and development expenses increased by $45.1 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $33.2 million increase related to additional personnel, including approximately 60 employees that we obtained as a result of our acquisition of MediaQ, a $21.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and increased depreciation and amortization charges, and a $2.0 million increase in facility expenses, offset by a $11.3 million decrease in 
new product development costs and other expenses during the period. Research and development expenses increased by $70.1 million, or 45%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $32.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $22.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $4.5 million increase related to engineering costs to develop next generation products, and a $10.5 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year. 17 We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues. Sales, General and Administrative . Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $12.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $9.1 million increase in tradeshow, marketing development and general administrative activities and a $3.2 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equ
ipment. These increases were offset by an $11.4 million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that have since been resolved, including the SEC inquiry, Microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $52.5 million, or 53%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $16.4 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $16.6 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings, a $9.0 million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems, a $7.9 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $2.6 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations, expand our sales, launch our new products and protect our business interests. In-process research and development. In connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5 million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs , as clarified by FIN 4, Applic
ability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2 , amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price. Stock Option Exchange. On September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer, or the Offer, to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share, or Eligible Options. Stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer, representing approximately 39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date. Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002 were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical, maternit
y, worker’s compensation, military or other statutorily protected leave of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. On October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61.8 million, consisting of $39.9 million in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21.9 million in employer and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the closing price of our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share. 18 Amortization of Goodwill. During fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The initial allocation of the purchase price included $57.4 million of goodwill, plus approximately $3.0 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place, which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. We have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment. Acquisition Related Charges. Acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002. These charges primarily consisted of bonuses to former 3dfx employees. Discontinued Use of Property. Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa Clara, California. Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. In December 2001, we filed a complaint against Extreme Networks Inc., the sublessor of the property, seeking payment of lease payments and other property charges for the period
 of July 2001 through December 2001 and seeking a declaration that we are not liable for any future payments under the lease. In July, 2003, we settled the matter with Extreme Networks and in August, 2003, the complaint was dismissed with prejudice. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income decreased from $23.2 million to $18.6 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. This was caused by the redemption of our $300.0 million convertible subordinated debentures in October 2003. Interest income decreased from $27.7 million to $23.2 million from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in market interest rates. Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on our convertible subordinated debentures. Interest expense decreased from $16.5 million to $12.0 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures. Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and any gains or losses related to the disposal of fixed assets. Other income increased by $3.2 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem our convertible subordinated debentures in October 2003. Convertible Debenture Redemption Expense On October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed our $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, or the Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October 26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a one-time charge of approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of unamortized issuance costs. 19 Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $12.3 million, $59.8 million and $75.8 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 14.1% in fiscal 2004, 39.7% in fiscal 2003 and 30.0% in fiscal 2002. Significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 included the $3.5 million MediaQ IPR&D write-off for which no tax benefit was recognized, the $75.0 million income tax benefit of certain tax contingencies as a result of settlement of our IRS exam, the $38.2 million income tax expense for the accrual of U.S. deferred income taxes on previous permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the $33.6 million income tax expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to projections of future sources of taxable income. Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of income tax expense. The increase in our annual effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to our not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense for that quarter was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available. We expect our annual effective income tax rate to be 20% for fiscal 2005. Please refer to Part II,   

Item 7 "Critical Accounting Policies - Income Taxes" for items that may affect this estimate. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 25, 2004, we had $604.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $424.4 million from the end of fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes in October 2003 and the $71.3 million acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities generated cash of $49.7 million, $265.0 million and $160.8 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in income taxes payable due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies. Cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities, the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities. Investing activities provided cash of $88.0 million and used cash of $277.3 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $286.9 million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities as we liquidated a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the $300.0 million Notes in October 2003. This increase in cash from sales and maturities of marketable securities was offset by $127.6 million in capital
 expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses and software and $71.3 million for the acquisition of MediaQ. We expect to spend approximately $80.0 million to $100.0 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2005, primarily for software licenses, emulation equipment, computer and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets. Financing activities used cash of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided of $26.3 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash used in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during the three months ended October 26, 2003. 20 Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our ne
ed to seek additional borrowings or capital include: · decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; · inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products; · competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and · new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see "Business Risks – Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline." Other key factors that could affect our liquidity include: Shelf Registration Statement In December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under their "shelf" registration process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March 25, 2004 . Under this shelf registration process, we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. In particular, we expect to incur significant operating expenses in connection with: · continuing to develop our technology; · hiring additional personnel; · expanding our sales and marketing organization and activities; · acquiring complementary technologies or businesses; and · capital expenditures 3dfx Asset Purchase The 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced n
umber of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. We are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfx’s subsequent bankruptcy in October 2002. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this litigation. 21 Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of January 25, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2–3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 5,047 $ 4,179 $ 868 $ -- $ -- Operating leases 206,242 24,635 49,950 50,625 81,032 Purchase obligations (1) 213,289 213,289 -- -- -- Other liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP 6,520 2,020 3,000 1,500 -- Total contractual obligations $ 431,098 $ 244,123 $ 53,818 $ 52,125 $ 81,032 _________________ (1)Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments as of January 25, 2004. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "New Accounting Pronouncements," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 22   

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the U.S. Government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as "available-for-sale" under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if inte
rest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because our debt securities are classified as "available-for-sale", no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of January 25, 2004, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $2.7 million. Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. Business Risks In addition to the risks discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," our business is subject to the risks set forth below. 23 Risks Related to Our Operations Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively. Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We currently use 0.15-micron, 0.14 micron and 0.13 micron process technologies for our family of GPUs, MCPs and UMPs. The majority of our newest GPUs, the GeForce FX and the GeForce FX Go products are manufactured in 0.13-micron process technology. We believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position. On February 24, 2004, we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select up-coming GPUs at TSMC's 0.11 um (micron) process technology. We have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. We may continue to have difficulty migrating to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis. Our inability to transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and harm our gross margins. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products would reduce our gross margins. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships, as well as revenue and gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or rec
all, our business could suffer. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Marv Burkett and David Shannon are our only officers or employees bound by an employment agreement, and so our relationships with our other officers and employees are at will. We do not have "key person" life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business. <
/DIV> Our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our gross margins. Inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to write-down our inventory and our gross margins could be adversely affected. 24 Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline . Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations. Factors that have affected our results of operations in the past, and could affect our results of operations in the future, include the following: · demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; · the successful development and volume production of next-generation products; · new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors; · our ability to introduce new products in accordance with original equipment manufacturers’, or OEMs’, design requirements and design cycles; · changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products; · fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields; · declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the U.S. and international economies; · competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; · product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; · the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders; · the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship; · seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market; · substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism or other cause; · supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory devices; · our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products; · legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits; · customer receivable bad debt write-offs; · costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products; · unexpected inventory write-downs; and · introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year. 25 Our operating expenses are relatively fixed, and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. Therefore, we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall. Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in co
nnection with selling workstation boards directly to major OEMs. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. To stay competitive, we may have to invest more resources in research and development. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts, our business could suffer. We have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1,057 full-time employees engaged in research and development as of January 25, 2004, compared to 832 employees as of January 26, 2003. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, research and development expenditures represented 15%, 12% and 11% as a percentage of revenue, respectively. Risks Related to Our Products PCI Express is central to our GPU as well as MCP strategies this year and the outcome of this strategy will impact our business. PCI Express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking. The transition to PCI Express, which is extremely complex, is central to our GPU and MCP strategies this year. We intend to lead this transition using a PCI Express high-speed interconnect, or HSI. HSI is a complex piece of networking technology that performs high-speed bi-directional interconnect protocol conversion. Using HSI, we expect to transform some of our GPUs into PCI Express compatible GPUs. With our PCI Express compatible GPUs, we expect that our partners will be able to launch PCI Express compatible solutions in April 2004. During fiscal 2005, we expect to launch and be in full production with a top-to-bottom product line of next generation PCI 
Express GPUs based on our brand new NV4X architecture. If we fail to deliver PCI Express in a timely manner or if our PCI Express compatible products do not meet consumer and/or analysts expectations, our business could suffer. We need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed. Our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for our target segments. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations. This requires that we do the following: · anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand; · incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of OEMs, ODMs, CEMs and add-in board and     motherboard manufacturers; · price our products competitively; and · introduce the products to the market within the limited window for OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. 26 As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following: · proper new product definition; · timely completion and introduction of new product designs; · the ability of International Business Machines, or IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, and any additional third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner; · the quality of any new products; · differentiation of new products from those of our competitors; · market acceptance of our products and our customers' products; and · availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products. A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc., IKOS Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC manufacturers. If these relationships are not successful, we may not
 be able to develop new products in a timely manner. In addition, our strategy includes utilizing the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by OEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of personal computers and consumer electronics. In addition, we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the OEMs’ design cycles and market demand. We have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance
 for new digital media processors would harm our business. In particular, we experienced delays in the introduction of digital media processors using our next generation technology during the first half of fiscal 2004 and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business. Our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business. As our digital media processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our digital media processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins. In order for our digital media processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our digital media processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them. We may be 
unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion new products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’, ODMs’, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development, introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed. In addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing with r
espect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our digital media processors non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory, any of which would harm our business. 27 We could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects. Products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future. Errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. Our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. If these defects or flaws exist and are not
 detected prior to volume production and distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Risks Related to Our Partners We sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of these customers. We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. Our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading PC OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and stocking representatives, each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading PC OEMs. Currently, we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors dire
ctly to stocking representatives, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading PC OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system builders. As a result, our business could be harmed by the loss of business from PC OEMs, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. In addition, revenue from PC OEMs, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income, which could harm our business. Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers' businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. As of the of fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2% of revenue for each fiscal year, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our opera
ting results. We may have to record additional reserves or write-offs in the future, which could harm our business. We depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our business. We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We utilize TSMC, IBM and UMC to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly, testing and packaging. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity at TSMC. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-term manufact
uring requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis. TSMC has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC, IBM and UMC fabricate wafers for other companies, including certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product. We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC, IBM, UMC and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. Any difficulties like these would harm our business. 28 There can be no assurance that IBM will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis. . On March 26, 2003, we announced that we have formed a multi-year strategic alliance under which IBM will manufacture our next-generation GeForce GPUs. As part of the agreement, we will gain access to IBM’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies, including power-efficient copper wiring, and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm (nanometer; a billionth of a meter) in the next several years, giving us valuable tools to advance our GPUs. IBM began manufacturing the next-generation GeForce graphics processor in July 2003 at IBM’s plant in East Fishkill, New York. During the development of our relationship with IBM, our manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of IBM. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, our business could suffer. We are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of our products. Our digital media processors are assembled and tested by Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., Amkor Technology, ChipPAC Incorporated and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality. Any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business. Due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to
 assemble or test our products or components. Any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business. We rely on third-party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products . In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party software development tools. While we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from digital media processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the software development tools we use become unavailable or f
ail to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could suffer. Microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of Xbox processors to Microsoft is uncertain. On August 14, 2003, Microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of Xbox processors to Microsoft is uncertain, but we do not anticipate that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least 18 – 24 months. Revenue from the sale of Xbox processors to Microsoft during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 accounted for 9%, 23% and 15%, respectively, of our total revenue. 29 We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products. In the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products, services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels. For any previous or future acquisition or investment, the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and, ultimately, could impair our ability to sell our products: · difficulty in combining the technology, operations or workforce of the acquired business; · disruption of our ongoing businesses; · difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction; · difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and · possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel. In addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock. If the consideration is paid with our common stock, existing stockholders would be further diluted. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: · the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval; · the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; · a classified board of directors; and · advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. In the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. Risks Related to Our Competition The 3D graphics, platform processor and handheld industries are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete. The market for GPUs, MCPs and UMPs for PCs and handhelds in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of digital media processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products, which c
ould harm our business. 30 Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide GPU and MCP solutions for the PC and handheld segments. Our competitors include the following: · suppliers of MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and VIA; · suppliers of desktop standalone GPUs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Creative Technology, Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd. and XGI Technology, Inc.,; · suppliers of notebook standalone GPUs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Silicon Motion. and the joint venture of a division of SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3 Incorporated) and VIA; and · suppliers of UMPs for handheld devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI and Seiko-Epson. If and to the extent we offer products outside of the personal computer, consumer electronics and handheld segments, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. Our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM and ODM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, generally based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. The process of being qualified for inclusion in an OEM’s product ca
n be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature, which also could harm our business. Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including Intel and Microsoft. This would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design wins could suffer. Risks Related to Market Conditions We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business. Our reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly, testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States, including the following: · unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; · delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; · longer payment cycles; · imposition of additional taxes and penalties; · the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and · other factors beyond our control, including terrorism and war, which may delay the shipment of our products. 31 We also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. Our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business. Our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing costs and yields, significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change.  If we are unable to respond to changes in our industry, which can be unpredictable and rapid, in an efficient and timely manner, our operating results could suffer.  In particular, from time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset
 declines in demand, our revenues and earnings will suffer during downturns. Our products may not continue to be accepted by the PC and consumer electronics segments. Our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our digital media processors for 3D graphics in PC and consumer electronics applications. The market for digital media processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition. Since the PC segment is our core business, our business would suff
er if for any reason our current or future digital media processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the PC segment. If we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the PC segment, our business would be harmed. We are dependent on the PC market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. During fiscal 2004, we derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop and notebook PC segments, including professional workstations . We expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop and notebook PC segments in the next several years. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, will reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inve
ntory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed. 32 Hostilities involving the United States and/or terrorist attacks could harm our business. The financial, political, economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the United States led to a weakening of the global economy. Subsequent terrorist acts and/or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the United States or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers, distributors and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Political instability in Taiwan and in The People’s Republic of China could harm our business. Because of our reliance on TSMC and UMC, our business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, or if relations between the U.S. and The People’s Republic of China are strained due to foreign relations events. Furthermore, any substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, acts of terrorism or war, equipment failure or other cause, could harm our business. Our stock price may continue to experience significant short-term fluctuations. The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non-company specific, such as the decline in the U.S. economy, acts of terror against the U.S., war or due to a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s stock, securities class action litigation had been initiated against the issuing company. We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates. We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the U.S. Government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as "available-for-sale" under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because our debt securities are classified as "
available-for-sale", no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation and Government Action Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. The digital media processor industry in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in our product lines intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may
 increase. If infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights. However, licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products, which could reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products. 33 Our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We have numerous patents issued and pending in the United States and in foreign countries. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products, including our digital media processors. We also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in
 particular countries and regions; the location in which our products are manufactured; our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or pa
yment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. Litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We are currently subject to claims of patent infringement, and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other parties in the future. These claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages. Future actions by the IRS or SEC or other governmental or regulatory agencies could harm our business. As of January 25, 2004, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, closed our federal income tax return exam for our fiscal years ended January 28, 2001 and January 27, 2002. The results of our exam were submitted to the Joint Committee on Taxation, or the Joint Committee, for review. With our exam closed, we recorded the tax benefit of the settlement in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 25, 2004 because we had certainty as to the outcome of certain tax contingencies for which we had established liabilities. However, the failure of the Joint Committee to agree with our settlement may result in a material adverse impact on the results of our operations in the period in which the matter is either resolved or in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Please refer to Part II,  

Item 7 "Results of Operations - Income Taxes" and Note 14 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We are subject to changes in financial accounting standards, which may affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, that may require us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options. We currently us the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to our employees. Under this method, we generally do no recognize compensation expense for an employee stock option when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. If any change to U.S. GAAP is adopted that requires us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options, our reported results of operations may be adversely affected. 34

Environment and Our Business GPU
Business Programmable
DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 GPUs . The
combination of the programmable GPU with Microsoft Corporation’s, or
Microsoft’s, DirectX 9 high-level shading language are known as DirectX 9 GPUs.
The flexibility and power of DirectX 9 GPUs can enhance high-definition digital
video, image processing and editing for digital photographs, as well as bring a
“cinematic look” to computer graphics. Technology and market leadership in this
generation of GPUs is a key element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2005,
our strategy was to regain architectural and technology leadership by leading
the industry with the first GPU to support DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 - the
GeForce 6 Series of GPUs. Beginning with the GeForce 6800 for the enthusiast
desktop segment, we introduced a complete family of GeForce 6 GPUs, including
the GeForce 6600 for the performance segment and GeForce 6200 for the mainstream
segment. Driven by next generation games such as id Software’s Doom 3 and Valve
Software’s Half-Life 2, consumer awareness and demand grew for our GeForce 6
family throughout our fiscal year. The GeForce 6 architecture is also the
foundation for our most current notebook and workstation GPU families. MCP
Business MCPs. The
NVIDIA nForce family of products represents our MCPs for Advanced Micro Devices,
Inc., or AMD,-based desktop, notebook, workstation PCs and servers. The
NVIDIA nForce architecture is also the foundation for our chipset that we sell
to Microsoft for the Microsoft Xbox gaming console. To date, the NVIDIA nForce
family of MCPs has received hundreds of editorial recommendations, including
more than 50 prestigious Editors’ Choice Awards. NVIDIA nForce2 products are
designed to offer best-in-class performance and feature rich media and
communications support for AMD Sempron platforms. NVIDIA nForce3
products, which consist of the NVIDIA nForce3, NVIDIA nForce3 Professional and
NVIDIA nForce3 Go, are designed to complement the latest 64-bit CPUs while
delivering innovative technologies for networking, storage and system
performance. In
October 2004, we introduced the NVIDIA nForce4 MCP, a new family of performance
PCI Express MCPs for AMD64 computing environments. In January 2005, we
introduced the NVIDIA nForce Professional MCP family, the industry’s only
PCI-Express core-logic solutions for AMD Opteron processor-based server and
workstation platforms. The NVIDIA nForce3, NVIDIA nForce4 and NVIDIA nForce
Professional families are designed to provide high-speed system performance,
unparalleled secure networking and advanced storage solutions for AMD64-based
desktop, workstation and server platforms. On November 19, 2004, we announced a
broad, multi-year cross-license agreement with Intel Corporation, or Intel. The
agreement spans multiple product lines and product generations, and includes a
multi-year chipset agreement that grants us a license to implement Intel’s
front-side bus technology. We
believe that this agreement opens a significant opportunity for us to bring our
NVIDIA nForce brand to the Intel segment. We expect to commence shipments of our
first Intel-based MCP product during the first quarter of fiscal
2006. WMP
Business WMPs. Since
our acquisition of MediaQ in fiscal 2004, our NVIDIA GoForce WMP family has
grown to include six new WMPs, including the GoForce3D 4800, GoForce3D 4500,
GoForce 4000, GoForce 3000, GoForce 2150 and GoForce 2000. The goal of every
device in the NVIDIA GoForce product family is to provide a high-performance,

introduced the GeForce 6200 GPU, which is designed for the mainstream consumer
segment. In
December 2004, we launched our GeForce 6200 GPU with TurboCache technology.
TurboCache technology is a new, patent pending hardware and software technology
that we believe is redefining the price/performance metrics for mainstream PCs.
TurboCache technology allows the GPU to render directly to system memory instead
of using local frame buffer memory on the graphics card, thereby lowering
on-board memory requirements and enabling OEMs and system builders to deliver
entry-level PCs with advanced GPU features and performance levels far superior
to those of integrated graphics. The
GeForceFX and GeForce4 currently deliver a balance of performance and features
for the mainstream accelerated graphics port-based, or AGP-based, PC

Quadro NVS workstation solutions are designed to meet the needs of a number of
workstation applications such as industrial product design, digital content
creation, non-linear video editing, scientific and medical visualization,
general purpose business and financial trading. NVIDIA Quadro products are fully
certified by several software developers for all professional workstation
applications, and are designed to deliver the graphics performance and precision
required by professional applications. Other. In
addition to the production launch of the GeForce 6 family during fiscal 2005, we
also introduced a number of technology initiatives that are designed to extend
the reach of our GPUs and expand the reach of the PC. We
created the industry-standard mobile PCI-Express module, or MXM, notebook GPU
module, which is designed to enable faster adoption of GPUs in notebooks. We
invented scalable link interface, or SLI, which brought extreme multi-GPU
graphics to enthusiasts and enabled a new class of PCs called Gaming
Supercomputers. PureVideo technology is the PC industry’s first programmable
video architecture and brings consumer electronics quality video to PCs.
TurboCache technology introduced the first frame buffer-less GPU, making modern
GPUs more affordable as they are burdened with less dynamic random-access memory
cost. Each of these innovations are industry firsts and have
received industry-wide support and acclaim. 3 MCPs . Our MCP
product family, known as NVIDIA nForce, supports desktop PCs, notebook PCs,
professional workstations and servers. We also provide a derivative of the
NVIDIA nForce2 chipset for the Microsoft Xbox video game console. NVIDIA
nForce. The
NVIDIA nForce family represents our MCPs for AMD-based desktop PCs, notebook
PCs, workstations and servers includes the NVIDIA nForce2, NVIDIA nForce3,
NVIDIA nForce4 and NVIDIA nForce Professional. We define a MCP as a single-chip
or chipset that can off-load system functions, such as audio processing and
network communications, and perform these operations independently from the host
central processing unit, or CPU. The NVIDIA nForce2 integrates a comprehensive
set of multimedia capabilities, such as two-dimensional, or 2D,
three-dimensional, or 3D, digital video disc, or DVD, high-definition
television, or HDTV, Dolby Digital audio playback and fast broadband and

work, learn, communicate and play. We believe that our expertise in
high-definition graphics and system architecture positions us to help drive this
transformation. We are using our expertise in the processing and transmission of
high-bandwidth digital media to develop products designed to address the
requirements of high-bandwidth concurrent multimedia. Sales
and Marketing Our
worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become
the leading supplier of performance GPUs, MCPs and WMPs for PCs, handheld
devices and consumer electronics platforms. Our sales and marketing teams work
closely with each industry’s respective OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,
motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and industry trendsetters,
collectively our Channel, to define product features, performance, price and
timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level of technical
expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive and
complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled team of application
engineers to assist the Channel in designing, testing and qualifying system
designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and quality of
our design support are key to improving the Channel’s time-to-market,
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the Channel and
fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of
our products. In the
GPU and MCP segments we serve, the sales process involves achieving key design
wins with leading OEMs and major system integrators and supporting the product
design into high volume production with key ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and
add-in board manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and
system integrator channel that is serviced by add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading
independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, ODMs, motherboard
manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors each of which has
relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong brand name
recognition in the retail channel. In the WMP segments we serve, the sales
process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading
handheld OEMs and supporting the product design into high-volume production.
Currently, we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors
directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board
manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading
OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators. Although a
small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue, their end
customers include a large number of OEMs and system integrators throughout the
world. 5 As a
result of our Channel strategy, our sales are focused on a small number of
customers. Sales to Edom Technology Co., Ltd., or Edom, accounted for 18% and
sales to Microsoft accounted for 13% of our total revenue for fiscal 2005. Edom
is an independent distributor. To
encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized
for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong
relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing
personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss
our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical
problems. Our developer program makes products available to developers prior to
volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles
that are optimized for our products. Backlog Our sales
are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of
products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to
revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by short
lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and
experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is
non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
portion is not significant. We do not believe that a backlog as of any
particular date is indicative of future results. Seasonality Our
industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the
seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue growth
in the second half of the calendar year related to the back-to-school and
holiday seasons. Manufacturing We do not
directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead we
utilize what is known as a “fabless” manufacturing strategy for all product-line
operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the
manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and
packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that
are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, in
such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability
and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the
significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing
operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the
raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus
our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and
customer support. We
utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, International
Business Machines Corporation, or IBM,
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered, and United Microelectronics
Corporation, or UMC, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize
independent subcontractors to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our
products. Our GPUs,
MCPs and WMPs are assembled, tested and packaged by Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering, Amkor Technology, STATS ChipPAC Incorporated and Siliconware
Precision Industries Company Ltd. We receive semiconductor products from our
subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to CEMs,
distributors, motherboard and add-in board manufacturer customers from our Santa
Clara, California warehouse and third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally,
these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and
test specifications, and then ship the products to retailers, system integrators
or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions. 6 Inventory
and Working Capital Our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and
other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with
our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a
product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products
that are based on this forecasted demand. The
quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment
schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’
requirements and in manufacturing availability. We
generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because t he
semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick
delivery schedules. Research
and Development We
believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to
deliver leading 3D graphics, high definition video, audio, ultra-low power
communications, storage, and secure networking performance and features is
essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to
focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs, MCPs and WMPs
using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are
performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware
engineering, very large scale integration, or VLSI, design engineering, process
engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline
designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations
of products. A
critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with
leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We invest significant
resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, including
Cadence Design Systems, Inc., and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these
companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that
forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to
design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of
the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology
on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design
schedules of PC manufacturers. We have
substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal
2004, and have 1,231 full-time employees engaged in research and development as
of January 30, 2005, compared to 1,057 employees as of January 25, 2004. During
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred research and development expenditures of
$335.1 million, $270.0 million and $224.9 million, respectively. Competition The
market for GPUs, MCPs and WMPs for PCs, handhelds and consumer electronics is
intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth
of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels,
backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs,
manufacturing capabilities, price of digital media processors and total system
costs of add-in boards or motherboards. We expect competition to increase both
from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less
costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not
provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market
share. We expect
substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling
platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as the Centrino platform.
An additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
or intend to provide GPU, MCP and WMP solutions for the PC, consumer electronics
and handheld segments. Our competitors include the following: · suppliers
      of MCPs that incorporate a combination of 3D graphics, networking, audio,
      communications and Input/Output, or I/O, functionality as part of their
      existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI, Broadcom

      of standalone notebook GPUs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as
      part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Silicon Motion Corporation,
      and the joint venture formed by SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3
      Incorporated) and VIA; and · suppliers
      of WMPs for handheld devices that incorporate advanced graphics
      functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Renesas
      Technology, Broadcom and Seiko-Epson. If and to
the extent we offer products outside of the PC, consumer electronics and
handheld segments, we may face competition from some of our existing
competitors, as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete.
We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new segments
we may enter. Patents
and Proprietary Rights We rely
primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and
third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our
intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our issued
patents have expiration dates from September 4, 2007 to December 11, 2022. We
have numerous patents issued and pending in the United States and in foreign
countries. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used
by us in connection with our products, including our digital media processors.
We also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to
protect our intellectual property. We continuously assess whether and where to
seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such
factors as: the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’
operations in particular countries and regions; the location in which our
products are manufactured; our strategic technology or product directions in
different countries; and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist
and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. Our
pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In
addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or
may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our
trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our
intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from
third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors, and expect to
continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses
may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of
technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are
not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. Employees As of
January 30, 2005 we had 2,101 employees, 1,231 of whom were engaged in research
and development and 870 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations and
administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees are
good. Financial
Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data During
the second quarter of fiscal 2005, our chief operating decision maker, the Chief
Executive Officer, began reviewing financial information presented on an
operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. We now report three product-line operating segments: the
GPU business, which is composed of products that support desktop PCs, notebook
PCs and professional workstations; the MCP business, which is composed of NVIDIA
nForce and Xbox products; and the WMP business, which supports handheld personal
digital assistants and cellular phones. In addition to these operating segments,
we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal, finance,
general administration and corporate marketing expenses that we do not allocate
to our other operating segments. “All Other” also includes the results of
operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that are neither
individually reportable, nor aggregated with another operating segment. Revenue
in the “All Other” category is primarily derived from sales of memory. The
information included in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements is hereby incorporated by reference. 8 Executive

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data”, our
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and the “Business
Risks” Section at the end of this   

Item 7, as well as other cautionary statements
and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, before deciding to
purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our
Company NVIDIA
Corporation is a worldwide leader in graphics and digital media processors
dedicated to creating products that enhance the interactive experience on
consumer and professional computing platforms. We design, develop and market
graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications processors, or
MCPs, wireless media processors, or WMPs, and related software. Our products are
integral to a wide variety of visual computing platforms, including enterprise
personal computers, or PCs, consumer PCs, professional workstations, notebook
PCs, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, game consoles and digital
media centers. We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and
reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our objective is to be one of the most
important and influential technology companies in the world. Recent
Developments Sony
Computer Entertainment Inc. In
December 2004, we announced that Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., or SCEI, and
NVIDIA are jointly developing a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation
GeForce GPU and SCEI’s system solutions for SCEI’s next generation PlayStation. The
collaboration includes licensing and royalties for the next generation
PlayStation as well as all derivatives, including next generation digital
consumer electronics devices. In addition, we are licensing to SCEI software
development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities. For
fiscal 2006, we expect to recognize revenue of approximately $30 million from
development and software license fees associated with this collaboration.
Depending on the ultimate success of this next generation platform, we expect to
generate, starting in fiscal 2007, revenue ranging from $50 million to $100
million annually from technology license fees and royalties over a four year
period, with the possibility of additional royalties for several years
thereafter. The additional royalty stream will depend on the use and success of
our technology in future digital consumer electronics devices such as digital
televisions and media servers. Intel
Cross-license Agreement On
November 19, 2004, NVIDIA and Intel announced that the companies
signed a broad, multi-year patent cross-license agreement spanning multiple
product lines and product generations. Additionally, the companies signed a
multi-year chipset agreement granting NVIDIA a license to implement Intel's
front-side bus technology. We believe that this agreement opens a significant
opportunity for us to bring our NVIDIA nForce brand to the Intel segment. We
expect to commence shipments of our first Intel-based MCP product during the
first quarter of fiscal 2006. GeForce
6 Series In April
2004, we announced our latest flagship GPU architecture, the GeForce 6 series.
The GeForce 6 series offers a number of new features, including a faster
architecture than our GeForce FX series, compliance with many of the latest
software standards and on-chip video processors for high-definition encoding and
decoding and direct-to-television playback. The GeForce 6 series offers more
flexibility for game designers and graphic artists, while increasing performance
over our previous top-end product, the GeForce FX 5950. During the second
quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched the production shipment of the GeForce 6800
Ultra, 6800 GT and 6800, the industry’s first GPUs to support Microsoft’s
DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched
the production shipment of the GeForce 6600 GT and 6600, which are intended for
the mainstream market, and the GeForce 6200, which delivers the GeForce 6 Series
architecture and performance to the value PC segment. In December 2004, we
introduced a version of the GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology. NVIDIA
TurboCache technology is a new, patent pending hardware and software technology,
which allows a GPU to render directly to system memory instead of using local
memory on the graphics card. Many of the world’s leading PC OEMs, system
builders, and add-in card partners have announced plans to build systems and
graphics cards utilizing the GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology. 15 In
December 2004, we announced NVIDIA PureVideo technology, which brings consumer
electronics quality video to PCs. PureVideo technology eliminates the need for
separate hardware or chipsets and takes the load off the PC’s multi-purpose CPU.
New notebooks and media centers powered by GeForce 6 with PureVideo technology
are expected to be introduced to the market soon. Peripheral
Component Interconnect Express, or PCI Express The
transition to PCI Express was central to our GPU and MCP objectives during
fiscal 2005. Industry adoption of PCI Express was slower than expected during
our fiscal 2005. In
February 2004, we announced a top-to-bottom family of PCI Express GPUs. By using
a PCI Express high-speed interconnect, or HSI, which is a complex piece of
networking technology that performs high-speed bi-directional interconnect
protocol conversion, we were able to transform our GeForce family of GPUs into
PCI Express compatible GPUs. In June 2004, we executed on our strategy to
deliver a full line of GPUs ready to support PCI Express chipsets. Our first PCI
Express graphics solutions, the GeForce PCX series, were released for retail
sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. In September 2004, we announced
the GeForce 6600 GT and the GeForce 6600. In October 2004, we announced the
GeForce 6200, our first native PCI Express GPUs. In November 2004, we
announced the launch of GeForce Go 6800 GPU, our first native PCI Express GPU
for notebook PCs. In May
2004, we announced the Mobile PCI Express Module Specification, or MXM. MXM was
jointly developed by NVIDIA and leading notebook PC manufacturers in an effort
to accelerate the adoption of PCI Express-based notebooks in all market
segments. MXM is an open design specification that supports a wide range of
graphics solutions from any GPU manufacturer, allowing system integrators
maximum flexibility for build-to-order with various graphics solutions. MXM also
serves as the primary delivery vehicle for our GeForce Go 6 series of GPUs. In August
2004, we announced that PCI-SIG, the Special Interest Group responsible for
Conventional PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express industry-standard I/O technologies, had
added our PCI Express technology-based products to the PCI-SIG Integrators List,
including GPUs designed for workstations, desktop PCs and notebook PCs. In
February 2005, we announced the NVIDIA Quadro FX Go 1400 mobile GPU for PCI
Express, which provides the performance, programmability, precision and quality
that CAD, DCC and scientific applications require. WMP
Business During
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Motorola, Inc. announced their decision to
incorporate our GoForce 4000 in their upcoming new line of 3G multimedia phones.
In July 2004, we announced that Samsung Electronics Co., or Samsung, had
selected our GoForce 2100 media processor for the SCH-M500 Mobile Intelligent
Terminal by Samsung, or MITS, phone. We now have design wins with three of the
world's top five cellular phone OEMs - Motorola, Samsung and LG Electronics,
Inc. In September 2004, we unveiled the GoForce 3D 4500, the world's first 3D
WMP. In February 2005, we announced the GoForce 3D 4800. Over the next several
years, we expect digital media processing technology to play a critical role in
the cellular phone industry. Scalable
Link Interface Technology In June
2004, we unveiled a new scalable
link interface, or SLI, technology that takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the PCI Express
bus architecture to allow two NVIDIA-based graphics cards to operate in a single
PC or workstation. PCI Express-based PCs and workstations based on NVIDIA SLI
technology became available in the second half of fiscal 2005 from PC and
workstation manufacturers. 16 NVIDIA
nForce During
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched production of the NVIDIA nForce3
250Gb MCP, the first single-chip MCP to offer gigabit Ethernet, dual independent
Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or SATA, controllers, industry leading
Redundant Array of Independent Disks, or RAID, features and hardware security
processing. In June 2004, we announced the release of the NVIDIA nForce3 Ultra
MCP, a MCP for motherboards and PC systems based on the AMD64 computing
platform. In October 2004, we introduced the NVIDIA nForce4 MCPs, our new family
of high-end PCI Express-based MCPs for AMD64 computing environments. NVIDIA
nForce4 MCPs provide the platform technology that is designed to power this
year's fastest gaming, enthusiast, and digital media PCs and motherboards,
driving the PCI Express transition. In
January 2005, we introduced NVIDIA nForce Professional MCPs, which currently are
the only PCI Express core-logic solutions for AMD Opteron processor-based server
and workstation platforms. The NVIDIA nForce Professional MCP family includes
the NVIDIA nForce Professional 2200 and the 2050 MCP. Share-Based
Payment Since
inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as
fundamental components of our compensation packages. To date we generally have
not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold
pursuant to our employee stock purchase program. We believe that these
incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting,
encourage our employees to remain with us. In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based
Payment , or
SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for interim or annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005, and requires that we record compensation
expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair
value of those awards. Expensing these incentives in future periods will
materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the
stock-based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported
earnings. To the extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant
stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may
decide to incur increased cash compensation costs. Repatriation
Legislation The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law on October 22, 2004. This
act creates a temporary incentive for United States multinationals to repatriate
accumulated income earned outside the United States at a federal effective tax
rate of 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 , which
allows an enterprise time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to
evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings. We have
started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we
do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the
Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of
the provision. We have not provided for United States income taxes on a
cumulative total of approximately $174.7 million of undistributed earnings as of
January 30, 2005 for certain non-United States subsidiaries as we intended to
reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the United States.
We are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not, and to what
extent, if any, this provision may benefit us. We expect to complete such
evaluation before the end of fiscal 2006. The range of possible amounts that we
are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500
million. The potential range of related income tax expense is between zero and
$27 million. Future
Objectives and Challenges GPU
Business During
fiscal 2005, we committed ourselves to recapture technology leadership in our
GPU business, while creating an architecture that is cost efficient. With our
GeForce 6 family, we captured a significant share of the performance GPU
segment, and we are now focused on using that technology leadership position
into the mainstream and value GPU segments. By the end of fiscal 2005, we had a
top-to-bottom product line that supports Shader Model 3.0 and with SLI, MXM,
HSI, TurboCache technology and PureVideo technology. Now, we are focused on
growing our GPU business. 17 PCI
Express PCI
Express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth
applications like graphics and networking. The transition to PCI Express, which
is extremely complex, is central to our GPU and MCP objectives this fiscal year.
We initiated this transition by creating our GeForce PCX series of GPUs, using
HSI technology. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we executed on our
strategy to deliver a full line of GPUs ready to support PCI Express chipsets.
The transition to PCI Express was central to our GPU and MCP objectives during
fiscal 2005. Industry adoption of PCI Express was slower than expected during
our fiscal 2005 and there is no assurance that the adoption rate will increase
during fiscal 2006. Our first PCI Express graphics solutions, the GeForce PCX
series, was released for retail sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
We expected to ramp up sales of our PCI Express products during the second
quarter of fiscal 2005, but as a result of Intel’s delayed PCI Express chipset
production, followed by its product recall, the performance desktop segment was
impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our GeForce PCX GPUs.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced and ramped up sales of
the GeForce 6600 GT, GeForce 6600 and the GeForce 6200, our first
native PCI Express GPUs. Gross
Margin Improvement During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, our gross margin was 34.2%, an increase of
4.9% from our gross margin of 29.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Our
gross margin was 32.3% for fiscal 2005, an increase of 3.3% from our gross
margin of 29.0% for fiscal 2004. These improvements in our gross margin reflect
our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures,
enhancing business processes and driving profitable growth. We expect gross
margin to improve by approximately 0.5% to 1.0% during the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 as our GeForce 6 product family becomes an increasing portion of our
revenue and as our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 product revenue continues
to increase. WMP
Business Our WMP
objective is to lead the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products
that use our expertise, resources, and investments in digital media processing
combined with our low power technology. Our WMP business achieved record revenue
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and is expected to achieve substantial
revenue levels in fiscal 2006. With the WMPs on our roadmap, we anticipate that
future cellular phones will be able to receive television programs, record
digital video like a camcorder, enable video phone calls, and be portable game
players. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are
based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost
of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going
basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill,
income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these
critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board
of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to
our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report. Revenue
Recognition Product
Revenue We
recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and
collection is reasonably assured. For all sales, we use a binding purchase order
and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an
arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk
of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the
arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably
assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we
defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably
assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. 18 Our
policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related
cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product. We record
estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is
recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed
to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9, Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products) and, as
such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage
factor. Unclaimed rebates, which historically have not been significant, are
reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. Rebates typically expire six
months from the date of the original sale. Our
customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account
for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance
with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs,
distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment
development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’
activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline,
we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs,
possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such
programs are offered. We also
record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on
historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal
period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales
return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for
product returns. License
and Development Revenue For
license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
property components, we generally recognize license revenue using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services are
performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based on
actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated
total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically
evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to
complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on
contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be
reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs
incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on
uncompleted contracts. If the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts
billed to customers, the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts
receivable. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the
excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period
is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress.
Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct
labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a
material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. Investment
Impairments We review
all of our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment. For
non-marketable equity securities, the impairment analysis requires significant
judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a
significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The indicators
that we use to identify those events or circumstances include the investee’s
revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall
business prospects, factors related to the investee’s ability remain in
business, such as the investee’s liquidity, and the investee’s receipt of
additional funding at a lower valuation. Investments
identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis
to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case
we write the investment down to its impaired value. When an investee is not
considered viable from a financial point of view, we write down the entire
investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal. If
an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying
amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the
new funding does not appear imminent, we presume that the investment is other
than temporarily impaired, unless specific facts and circumstances indicate
otherwise. Impairments of investments in our portfolio, primarily impairments of
non-marketable equity securities, were nil in fiscal 2005 and 2004. 19 Accounts
Receivable We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for
specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated
exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are
covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of
our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our
credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could
adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current
credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, -----2005. As of
January 30, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.5
million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $336.2 million. Of the
$336.2 million, $68.0 million was covered by credit insurance and $22.4 million
was covered by letters of credit. As a percentage of our gross accounts
receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged
between 0.4% and 1.5% during fiscal 2004 and 2005. As of January 30, 2005, our
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.4% of our gross
accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable
would have been recorded at 1.5% of our gross accounts receivable balance, then
our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 30, 2005 would
have been approximately $4.9 million, rather than the actual balance of $1.5
million. Inventories Inventory
cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost
on an average or first-in, first-out basis). We write down our inventory for
estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal
to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value
based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments,
estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our
future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted
future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs may be
required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market
conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products
are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on
our gross margin. As of January 30, 2005, our inventory reserve was $33.7
million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve
has ranged between 8.8% and 13.4% during fiscal 2004 and 2005. As of January 30,
2005, our inventory reserve represented 9.6% of our gross inventory balance. If
our inventory reserve would have been recorded at 13.4% of our gross inventory
balance, then our inventory reserve balance at January 30, 2005 would have been
approximately $46.8 million, rather than the actual balance of $33.7 million.
Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory
has been sold or scrapped. Valuation
of Long-lived Assets We review
long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject
to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We utilize a two-step
approach to testing long-lived assets for impairment. The first step tests for
possible impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator is present, the
second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of
the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset. Our review requires the use of judgment and estimates. No such
impairment charges have occurred to date. However, future events or
circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the
carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. 20 Goodwill Our
impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in
which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We
determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for
the purposes of completing our Stateme nt of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets , impairm ent test. We utilize a
two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for
possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test. The second step, if
necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair
value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform
our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005 and concluded that there was no impairment. However,
future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future
periods due to the potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with
such tests. Income
Taxes Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes ,
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and
foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable
or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize
federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate,
for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax
assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and
judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our
calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on
certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax
assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality
to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the United
States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or
circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States
and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of
these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our
current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or
additional income tax expense in our financial statements. As of
January 30, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $190.6 million. Of the total
valuation allowance, $145.7 million is attributable to certain net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, if and when realization is sustained, will be accounted for as a
credit to stockholders' equity. Of the remaining valuation allowance at January
30, 2005, $19.9 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in
certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets
was determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to
potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes; and $25.0
million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined
are not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to projections of
future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets
related to certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these tax
benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current
intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit
reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of the
deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable, we
would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely
than not to be realized. Contingencies We are
subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary
course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset
or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate
the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss
contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether
such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. 21 Results

Years Ended January 30, 2005, January 25, 2004 and January 26, 2003 Revenue During
the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we began reporting three product-line
operating segments: the GPU business, which is composed of products that support
desktop PCs, notebook PCs and professional workstations; the MCP business, which
is composed of NVIDIA nForce products and Xbox related products; and the WMP
business, which is comprised of GoForce products that support handheld personal
digital assistants and cellular phones. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Revenue
was $2.01 billion in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.82 billion in fiscal 2004,
which represented an increase of 10%. The revenue increase from fiscal 2004 to
fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increased sales of our NVIDIA Quadro
workstation products, increased memory sales, increased sales of our handheld
products, increased sales of our notebook GPU products, and increased sales of
our desktop products, offset by decreased sales of our Xbox products. The
increase in sales of our NVIDIA Quadro workstation products in fiscal 2005 was
due to unit sales volume increases, and an increase in average selling prices as
a result of increased board sales. The increase in memory sales in fiscal 2005
was a result of the alignment of memory sales with the introduction of our
GeForce 6 products during the period. The increase in handheld sales in fiscal
2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. in October 2003, which
represented our initial entry into the handheld market and to sales of our
GoForce 4000 product. The increase in notebook GPU sales in fiscal 2005 resulted
from sales of our GeForce FX Go notebook GPU products outpacing the decline in
our older notebook GPU product lines during the period. The increase in desktop
products in fiscal 2005 was a result of a significant increase in sales of our
high-end desktop products, offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop
products. High-end desktop sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit
volume increases primarily related to our GeForce 6800 and 6600 products. The
decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was mainly due to
competitive pricing in the mainstream consumer segment offset by the ramp of
product sales of our GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005. Sales of our Xbox products have historically fluctuated
based on the timing of orders from Microsoft. Revenue from sales to Microsoft in
fiscal 2005 was slightly lower than fiscal 2004 due to unit sales volume
increases offset by a lower average sales price. During fiscal 2004, Microsoft
announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to
develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this
announcement may have on our future revenue from Microsoft is uncertain, but we
anticipate that we will not achieve historical levels of Xbox revenue in fiscal
2006. 22 Fiscal
2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal 2004 which was a 52-week year, and
we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in
fiscal 2005. However, we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly
longer year on our revenue. Revenue
was $1.82 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $1.91 billion in fiscal 2003,
which represented a decrease of 5%. This revenue decrease was primarily the
result of a significant decrease in sales of Xbox processors to Microsoft,
offset by growth in our GPU, MCP and WMP products. Revenue
from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas
accounted for 76%, 75% and 68% of total revenue for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries
based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the
foreign CEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is
attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the
percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and
other Americas for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs
used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which are billed to Microsoft in the United
States. Sales to
Microsoft accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue for fiscal 2005. Our
three other largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue for
fiscal 2005. Sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue
for fiscal 2004. Our three other largest customers accounted for approximately
45% of our revenue for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, sales to Microsoft accounted
for approximately 23% of our revenue. Our three other largest customers
accounted for approximately 41% of our revenue for fiscal 2003. Gross
Profit Gross
profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost
of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from
subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such
purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs.
Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary
in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross
margin was 32%, 29% and 30% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross
margin improved during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of three
primary factors. First, during fiscal 2004 our GeForce FX series of GPU products
had experienced lower gross margins than previous series of GeForce GPU
products, such as the GeForce 4 series. Company-wide efforts were made to drive
down cost and improve gross margin and, as a result, during fiscal 2005, we were
able to improve our gross margin. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we realized
increased sales of our performance GeForce FX desktop GPU products and began
shipping our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which are among our highest gross margin
products. Finally, revenue from our NVIDIA Quadro workstation products, which
typically provide the highest gross margins of any of our products, increased as
a percentage of our total revenue during fiscal 2005. This increase in our mix
of revenue toward higher-margin products led to a positive impact on overall
gross margin. These improvements in our gross margin reflect our continuing
focus on delivering cost effective product architecture, enhancing business
process and driving profitable growth. We expect gross margin to improve by
approximately 0.5% to 1.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as our
GeForce 6 product family comprises an increasing portion of our revenue and as
NVIDIA nForce product revenue continues to increase. Gross
margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a
shift in the mix of product sales to our GeForce FX products. Our GeForce FX
products generally experienced lower gross margins than previous GeForce
products. This decrease was offset by an increase in gross margin on sales of
Xbox processors in fiscal 2004, which resulted from the pricing settlement with
Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003. 23 Operating

additional personnel and a $10.4 million increase in new product developments
costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape-outs and in
prototype materials. Depreciation and amortization increased $11.5 million due
to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal
2004, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2005 compared to a
partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004. Computer software and equipment
increased $4.2 million primarily due to increased allocation of information
technology expenses and facilities increased $3.1 million due to increased
facilities expense allocation, both based on the growth in headcount. Research
and development expenses increased by $45.1 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $33.2 million increase related to additional
personnel, including approximately 60 employees that we hired as a part of our
acquisition of MediaQ and a $17.7 million increase in depreciation and
amortization, offset by a $10.4 million decrease in new product development
costs. We
anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and
development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the
foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of
products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to
fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental
investments in research and development and these investments may be independent
of our level of revenue. 24 Sales,

additional personnel and a $19.4 million increase in advertising and promotion
costs for tradeshows and new product launches and other marketing costs,
including travel and customer samples. These increases were offset by a decrease
of $1.9 million in other expenses during the period, including a reduction in
the allowance for doubtful accounts. Sales,
general and administrative expenses increased $13.7 million, or 9%, from fiscal
2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in salaries and
related benefits related to additional personnel, a $7.6 million increase in
advertising and promotions costs for tradeshows and marketing development and a
$3.2 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the
enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new
equipment. These increases were offset by a $7.4 million decrease in legal fees
related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that
have since been resolved, including an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits. In-process
research and development In
connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5
million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had
not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. In
accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting

clarified by FIN 4, Applicability
of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an
interpretation of SFAS No. 2 , amounts
assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to
expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price. Interest
Income and Interest Expense Interest
income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. Interest income decreased from $18.6 million to $11.4 million from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the result of lower overall balances
of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and due to lower market
interest rates. Interest income decreased from $23.2 million to $18.6 million
from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower overall balances of cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to
fiscal 2003. This overall decrease was caused by the redemption of our $300.0
million 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, or the Notes, in
October 2003. 25 Interest
expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease
obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on the Notes.
Interest expense decreased from $12.0 million to $0.2 million from fiscal 2004
to fiscal 2005. Interest expense decreased from $16.5 million to $12.0 million
from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. These decreases were primarily due to the
redemption of the Notes. Other
Income (Expense), net Other
income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale
of marketable securities. Other income decreased by $2.4 million
from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized
gains on the sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our
liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in
order to obtain the cash required to redeem the Notes in October 2003. This
decrease was offset by a $1.0 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related
to the receipt of cash and marketable securities as part of an investment
exchange. Stock
Option Exchange On
September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer, or the Offer, to our employees to
exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
$27.00 per share, or Eligible Options. The Offer
was implemented in order to improve employee morale by realigning the cash and
equity components of our compensation programs, eliminate significant
out-of-the-money options and reduce the number of outstanding stock options
relative to the number of shares outstanding, or "options overhang", thereby
reducing future potential dilution to existing stockholders. Stock
options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were
eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer, representing approximately
39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date of the offer.
Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who
continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002
were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical,
maternity, worker’s compensation, military or other statutorily protected leaves
of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in
the Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date
of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board
of Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. Eligible
employees who participated in the Offer received, in exchange for the
cancellation of Eligible Options, a fixed amount of consideration, represented
by fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock less applicable withholding taxes,
equal to the number of shares underlying such Eligible Options, multiplied by
$3.20, less the amount of applicable tax withholdings, divided by $10.46, the
closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
October 24, 2002. We concluded that the consideration paid for the Eligible
Options represented "substantial consideration" as required by Issue 39(f) of
EITF Issue No. 00-23 "Issues Relating to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under
APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44," as the $3.20 per Eligible
Option was at least the fair value for each Eligible Option, as determined using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the fair value of the
Eligible Options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we used the
following assumptions: (i) the expected remaining life was deemed to be the
remaining term of the options, which was approximately 7.8 years; (ii) a
volatility of 50.0% during the expected life; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of
3.71%; and (iv) no dividends. The amount of $3.20 per Eligible Option was
established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged
throughout the offer period. Variable
accounting is not required under Issue 39(a) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 for
Eligible Options subject to the Offer that were not surrendered for
cancellation, because: (i) the shares of our common stock offered as
consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non-forfeitable;
and (ii) the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the
Offer was based on the number of surrendered Eligible Options multiplied by
$3.20, divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange. We
further concluded that the "look back" and "look forward" provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 44, paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered
for cancellation. Based on the terms of the Offer, variable accounting is not
required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the
Offer. We did not grant stock options to any participants in the Offer for at
least six months following October 24, 2002. If any stock options were granted
to participants in the Offer within the six months following October 24, 2002,
those stock options would have received variable accounting. 26 On
October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange
approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61.8
million, consisting of $39.9 million in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of
our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21.9 million in employer
and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares
of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total
consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the
closing price of our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share. The
shares of our common stock issued in exchange for Eligible Options were fully
vested. However, a portion of the shares equal to 25% of the total
consideration, based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer
termination date, have a six month holding period, and a portion of the shares
equal to 25% of such total consideration have a one year holding period.
Withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50% of the
total consideration, and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a
holding restriction. Income
Taxes We
recognized income tax expense of $25.1 million, $12.3 million and $59.8 million
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage
of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 20% in fiscal
2005, 14.1% in fiscal 2004 and 39.7% in fiscal 2003. In the
second quarter of fiscal 2004, we revised our annual effective tax rate for the
year from 30% to 20%. The change in rate was primarily due to federal and state
tax credits and foreign tax rate differentials. In the third and fourth quarters
of fiscal 2004, we had significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate
which included the $3.5 million MediaQ IPR&D write-off for which no tax
benefit was recognized, the $75.0 million income tax benefit of certain tax
contingencies as a result of settlement of our federal income tax return exam by
the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the $38.2 million income tax expense for
the accrual of United States deferred income taxes on previous permanently
reinvested foreign earnings and the $33.6 million income tax expense for the
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state
deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not the be realized due, in
part, to projections of future taxable income. As a result of this change in
rate and the special items incurred during 2004, our annual effective tax rate
for such year was 14.1%. In fiscal 2003, we did not record an income tax benefit
for the third quarter loss before income tax expense as such loss was primarily
attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no income tax benefit may
have been available. As a result, our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2003
was 39.7%. As of
January 25, 2004, the IRS closed our federal income tax return exam for our
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2005, the Joint Committee on
Taxation, or the Joint Committee, completed its review of our IRS exam for these
fiscal years and closed such exam with no exception to the conclusions reached
by the IRS. Accordingly, the results of our exam as recorded in our financial
statements for fiscal 2004 accurately reflected our final settlement reached
with the IRS that was subsequently closed, without exception, by the Joint
Committee during fiscal 2005. Please
refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information regarding the components of our income tax
expense. Convertible
Debenture Redemption Expense On
October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. The aggregate principal amount of
the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes
that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October
26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up
to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the
Notes, we recorded a one-time charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately $13.1
million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of
unamortized issuance costs. 27 Liquidity
and Capital Resources As of
January 30, 2005, we had $670.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, an increase of $66.0 million from the end of fiscal 2004. Our
portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several
financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier
investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain
limits on our portfolio duration. Operating
activities generated cash of $132.2 million, $49.7 million and $265.0 million
during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in cash flows from
operating activities in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily
related to the $25.9 million increase in net income and changes in operating
assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities
increased $37.3 million primarily due to an increase in rebates payable, which
resulted from increased OEM business. Accounts payable increased $52.9 million
primarily due to purchases from subcontract manufacturers for inventory.
Offsetting these increases, our accounts receivable increased $101.1 million
primarily due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as
compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Investing
activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable
securities, purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold
improvements for our facilities and intangible assets. Investing activities used
cash of $152.0 million and provided cash of $88.0 million during fiscal 2005 and
2004, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was
primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable securities. In
addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable
to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our
headquarters campus, new research and development emulation equipment,
technology licenses, software and intangible assets. We expect to spend
approximately $50 million to $70 million for capital expenditures during fiscal
2006, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation equipment,
computer and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash
in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets. Financing
activities provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005 compared to cash
used of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004. Cash provided in fiscal 2005
primarily resulted from $--42.5 million of common stock issued under employee
stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock repurchase program. In
fiscal 2004, the cash used was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of
the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during
the three months ended October 26, 2003. Stock
Repurchase Program On August
9, 2004, we announced a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up
to $300.0 million of our common stock over a three year period through August
2007. The repurchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, from time to time, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, subject to market conditions, applicable legal
requirements and other factors. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate
us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended at any
time at our discretion. The repurchases will be funded from our available
working capital. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a
total cost of approximately $24.6 million. We did not repurchase any shares
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Operating
Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We
believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance
that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this
time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at
all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require
additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are
unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital
equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm
our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from
operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital
include: · decreased
      demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’
      products; · inability
      to successfully develop and produce in volume production our
      next-generation products; · competitive
      pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;
      and · new
      product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For
additional factors see “Business Risks - Risks Related to Our Operations - Our
operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating
results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our
stock price could decline.” 28 Shelf
Registration Statement In
December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the SEC under its "shelf" registration
process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March 25,
2004. Under this shelf registration statement, we may sell common stock,
preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or
stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of
$500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus
supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general
corporate purposes. 3dfx
Asset Purchase The 3dfx
asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less
$15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated
December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the
other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and
other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to
pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such
a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities
could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to
receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a
reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by
dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that
all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be
satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the
agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. We are currently
party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfx’s
subsequent bankruptcy in October 2002. Please refer to   

 ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest
Rate Risk We invest
in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in
commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We
account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . All of
the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
"available-for-sale" under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk.
Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a
rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that
decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we
classify our debt securities as "available-for-sale," no gains or losses are
recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold
prior to maturity. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of
January 30, 2005, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed
rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the
yield curve of both +/-50 basis points would result in changes in fair market
values for these investments of approximately $2.9 million. Exchange
Rate Risk We
consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and therefore are not
subject to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in any
currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

      and
      is composed of our contractual arrangements with Sony Computer Entertainment,
      or
      SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce
      GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, sales of our Xbox-related
      products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft Corporation, or
      Microsoft, relating to the successor product to their initial Xbox gaming
      console, the Xbox360, and related devices, and digital media processor
      products. We
      were
      incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in
      April
      1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California. Our Internet
      address is www.nvidia.com . Original
      equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs,
      add-in-card manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics companies
      worldwide utilize NVIDIA digital media processors as a core component of their
      entertainment and business solutions. Our award-winning GPUs deliver superior
      performance and crisp visual quality for PC-based applications such as
      manufacturing, science, e-business, entertainment and education. Our
      critically-acclaimed MCPs perform highly demanding multimedia processing for
      secure broadband connectivity, communications and breakthrough audio functions.
      Our handheld GPUs deliver an advanced visual experience by accelerating graphics
      and video applications while implementing design techniques that result in
      high
      performance and low power consumption. Our
      Business GPU
      Business The
      combination of the programmable GPU with Microsoft’s, DirectX 9.0 high-level
      shading language is known as DirectX 9.0 GPUs. The flexibility and power of
      DirectX 9 GPUs can enhance high-definition, or HD, digital video, image
      processing and editing for digital photographs, as well as bring a “cinematic
      look” to computer graphics. Technology and market leadership in this generation
      of GPUs continues to be a key element of our corporate strategy. The successful
      production launch of our GeForce 6800 and 6600 GPU series in fiscal 2005 led
      to
      our increase in market share from 21% to 67% of the Performance DirectX
      9.0-compatible graphics controller segment, according to the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2003 and 2004 PC Graphics Reports,
      respectively .
      In
      fiscal 2006, our strategy was to extend our architectural and technology
      advantage by leading the industry with our second-generation GPU to support
      DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 - the GeForce 7800 GPU. By successfully extending
      our
      leadership position in the performance segment with the production release
      of
      the GeForce 7800 in June 2005, we grew our market share from 67% to 79%,
      according to the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2004 and 2005 PC Graphics Reports,
      respectively .
      In
      January 2006, we launched and initiated sales of the GeForce 7300 GPU, our
      first
      mainstream version of the GeForce 7 Series. The GeForce 6 and 7 Series desktop
      and notebook GPUs are designed to be compatible with Microsoft’s next generation
      operating system, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, which is scheduled to
      be
      released in the second half of calendar 2006. Vista is expected to mark a
      dramatic improvement in the way the Windows operating system takes advantage
      of
      the PC’s GPU to provide a positive user experience. The
      NVIDIA Quadro brand has become the benchmark of performance and compatibility
      for the professional industry.  During fiscal 2006, the growth in our
      Quadro professional workstation products was a reflection of the digital
      revolution sweeping nearly every industry, from industrial design, to industrial
      styling, to film, to HD broadcast, to medical imaging and many more. In the
      future, we expect the growth of our professional workstation products to be
      influenced by the demand for HD content creation, HD video editing and HD
      broadcast. 2 MCP
      Business The
      NVIDIA nForce family of products represents our MCPs for Advanced Micro Devices,
      Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel,-based desktop, notebook,
      professional workstations and servers. Our strategy for MCPs aligns with what
      we
      anticipate will drive growth such as multi-core, ever-increasing-speed
      networking and storage technologies, and integration of complex features such
      as
      virtualization, security processing, network processing and more. The In-Stat
      Trendy Chipset for the x86 Processor Report projects strong growth for PC
      chipsets through the end of this decade: from $7.6 billion in 2006 to over
      $10
      billion in 2009. In
      September 2005, we introduced our first integrated graphics core logic solutions
      in more than two years, the GeForce 6100 Series GPU and NVIDIA nForce 400 Series
      MCP. We offer the industry’s first and only integrated core logic to feature
      DirectX 9.0 and Shader Model 3.0 technology. We
      also
      offer PureVideo technology, a HD video processor designed to deliver a home
      theater-quality movie watching experience on PCs and media centers. NVIDIA
      is
      now the third largest core logic supplier in the world, according to the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2005 PC Graphics Report .
      We are
      the largest supplier of AMD 64 chipsets with 38% segment share. NVIDIA nForce
      MCP unit shipments for AMD64-based CPUs increased over 510% year-over year,
      based on the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2005 PC Processor Forecast Report . Handheld
      GPU Business Our
      strategy in our Handheld GPU Business is to lead innovation and capitalize
      on
      the emergence of the cellular phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle
      device. The
      hallmark of every device in the
      NVIDIA GoForce product family is to provide a high-performance, visually rich
      multimedia experience on cellular phones and handheld devices. These products
      deliver an advanced visual experience by accelerating graphics and video
      applications, and supporting the most demanded features and capabilities.
      GoForce handheld GPUs implement innovative design techniques, both inside the
      chips and at the system level, which result in high performance and long battery
      life. These technologies enhance visual display capabilities, improve
      connectivity, and minimize chip and system-level power consumption. GoForce
      products can be found in advanced multimedia cellular phones, PDAs, and other
      handheld devices. Consumer
      Electronics Business Our
      Consumer Electronics Business is composed of our contractual arrangements
      with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation
      GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, sales of our
      Xbox-related products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft
      relating to the successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the

      and Marketing Our
      worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become
      the leading supplier of performance GPUs, MCPs, and handheld GPUs for PCs,
      handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms. Our sales and marketing
      teams work closely with each industry’s respective OEMs, ODMs, system
      integrators, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and industry
      trendsetters, collectively our channel, to define product features, performance,
      price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level
      of
      technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive
      and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled team of
      application engineers to assist the channel in designing, testing and qualifying
      system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and
      quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s time-to-market,
      maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and
      fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation
      of
      our products. In
      the
      GPU, MCP, and handheld GPU segments we serve, the sales process involves
      achieving key design wins with leading OEMs and major system integrators and
      supporting the product design into high volume production with key ODMs,
      motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers. These design wins
      in
      turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by
      add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to
      work
      with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs,
      ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors
      each of which has relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong
      brand name recognition in the retail channel. In the handheld GPU segments
      we
      serve, the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly
      with the leading handheld OEMs and supporting the product design into
      high-volume production. Currently, we sell a significant portion of our digital
      media processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers
      and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our
      products to leading OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system
      integrators. Although a small number of our customers represent the majority
      of
      our revenue, their end customers include a large number of OEMs and system
      integrators throughout the world. As
      a
      result of our channel strategy, our sales are focused on a small number of
      customers. Sales to Edom Technology Co., Ltd., or Edom, accounted for 14% and
      sales to Asustek Computer Inc., or Asustek, accounted for 12% of our total
      revenue for fiscal 2006. Edom is an independent distributor and Asustek is
      a
      CEM. To
      encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized
      for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong
      relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing
      personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss
      our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical
      problems. Our developer program makes products available to developers prior
      to
      volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles
      that are optimized for our products. Backlog Our
      sales
      are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of
      products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject
      to
      revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
      manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by
      short
      lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice
      and
      experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is
      non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
      portion is not significant. We do not believe that a backlog as of any
      particular date is indicative of future results. Seasonality Our
      industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the
      seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue
      performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the
      back-to-school and holiday seasons. 7 Manufacturing We
      do not
      directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead we
      utilize what is known as a “fabless” manufacturing strategy for all product-line
      operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of
      the
      manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and
      packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that
      are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO,
      in
      such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability
      and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the
      significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing
      operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the
      raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus
      our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and
      customer support. We
      utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Chartered Semiconductor
      Manufacturing, or Chartered, Semiconductor Manufacturing International
      Corporation, or SMIC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC,
      and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, to produce our semiconductor
      wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced
      Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics
      Co.,
      LTD, or KYEC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., or SPIL, and STATS
      ChipPAC Incorporated to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of
      our
      products. We
      typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform
      incoming quality assurance and then ship them to CEMs, distributors, motherboard
      and add-in board manufacturer customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong
      Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on
      our
      design kit and test specifications, and then ship the products to retailers,
      system integrators or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions. Inventory
      and Working Capital Our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and
      other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating
      with
      our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on
      a
      product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products
      that are based on this forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually
      purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to
      revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
      manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of
      our
      products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead
      time
      orders and quick delivery schedules. Research
      and Development We
      believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed
      to
      deliver leading 3D graphics, HD video, audio, low power communications, storage,
      and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future
      success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently
      developing multiple generations of GPUs, MCPs and Handheld GPUs using
      independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed
      within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware
      engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process
      engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline
      designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations
      of products. A
      critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with
      leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We invest significant
      resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, including
      Cadence Design Systems, Inc., and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these
      companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that
      forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools
      to
      design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront
      of
      the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology
      on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design
      schedules of PC OEM and other manufacturers. 8 We
      have
      substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal
      2005, and have 1,654 full-time employees engaged in research and development
      as
      of January 29, 2006, compared to 1,231 employees as of January 30, 2005. During
      fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred research and development expenditures
      of
      $352.1 million, $335.1 million and $270.0 million, respectively. Competition The
      market for GPUs, MCPs and handheld GPUs is intensely competitive and is
      characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and
      declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive
      factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
      to
      customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support,
      conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces, or APIs,
      manufacturing capabilities, price of processors and total system costs of add-in
      boards or motherboards. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will
      depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
      customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes
      of
      our products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase
      both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may
      be
      less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features
      not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors
      or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market
      share. An
      additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
      or
      intend to provide GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPU solutions. Some of our competitors
      may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources
      than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.
      Our current competitors include the following: · suppliers
                of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
                communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of
                their
                existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI, Broadcom
                Corporation, or Broadcom, and
                Intel; · suppliers
                of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality
                as part
                of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Intel, Matrox Electronics
                Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems, Inc., VIA Technologies,
                Inc.,
                and XGI Technology Inc.; and · suppliers
                of GPUs or GPU intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices
                that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their
                existing
                solutions, such as ATI, Bitboys, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited, Imagination
                Technologies Ltd., NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas
                Technology Corp., Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and
                Toshiba
                America, Inc. We
      expect
      substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling
      platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as when Intel achieved
      success with its Centrino platform solution. In addition to its current Centrino
      notebook platform initiative, and its announced upcoming desktop initiative
      branded as VIIV, we expect that Intel is now focused on developing and selling
      platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and
      servers. If Intel continues to pursue these initiatives, we may not be able
      to
      successfully compete in these segments. If
      and to
      the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise PC,
      notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console markets,
      we
      may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from
      companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict
      if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are
      unable to compete in our current and any new markets, our financial results
      will
      suffer. Patents
      and Proprietary Rights We
      rely
      primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee
      and
      third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect
      our
      intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our issued
      patents have expiration dates from September 4, 2007 to September 2, 2024.
      We
      have numerous patents issued and pending in the United States and in foreign
      countries. Our patents and pending patent 9 applications
      relate to technology used by us in connection with our products, including
      our
      digital media processors. We also rely on international treaties and
      organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. We
      continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular
      innovations and technologies based on such factors as: the commercial
      significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular
      countries and regions; the location in which our products are manufactured;
      our
      strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and the
      degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced
      in different jurisdictions. Our
      pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved.
      In
      addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages
      or
      may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
      harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
      substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
      our
      trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect
      our
      intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology
      from
      third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors, and expect
      to
      continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses
      may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of
      technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are
      not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. Employees As
      of
      January 29, 2006 we had 2,737 employees, 1,654 of whom were engaged in research
      and development and 1,083 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations
      and administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective
      bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees
      are
      good. Financial
      Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data Our
      Chief
      Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
      or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis
      for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
      During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments
      to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position
      ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. We now report financial information for four product-line
      operating segments to our CODM: the GPU Business is composed of products that
      support desktop PCs, notebook PCs and professional workstations; the MCP
      Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip
      or
      chipset that can off-load system functions, such as audio processing and network
      communications, and perform these operations independently from the host CPU;
      our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support handheld personal
      digital assistants, cellular phones and other handheld devices; and our Consumer
      Electronics Business is concentrated in products that support video game
      consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of
      revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3, revenue from sales of our Xbox-related
      products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
      successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related
      devices, and digital media processor products. In addition to these operating
      segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal,
      finance, general administration and corporate marketing expenses, which total
      $121.2 million and $101.5 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, that
      we do not allocate to our other operating segments. “All Other” also includes
      the results of operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that are
      neither individually reportable, nor aggregated with another operating segment.
      Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily derived from sales of
      memory.  All prior period amounts have been restated to reflect our new
      reporting structure. Our
      CODM
      does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
      basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
      there is none to be reported.  The accounting policies for segment
      reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.  The information included
      in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is hereby
      incorporated by reference. 10 Executive

ITEM
      7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
      OPERATIONS The
      following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
      operations should be read in conjunction with “  

 ITEM
      7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest
      Rate Risk We
      invest
      in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments
      in
      commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
      corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
      These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities .
      All of
      the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
      floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate
      risk.
      Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to
      a
      rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
      than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
      investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
      rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities
      that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because
      we classify our debt securities as “available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are
      recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold
      prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than
      temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
      a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. 50 As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed
      rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the
      yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values
      for
      these investments of approximately $2.6 million. Exchange
      Rate Risk We
      consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
      minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
      provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are
      not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United
      States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more
      expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,
      decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
      could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing
      business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging
      activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency
      exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

 ITEM
      7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest
      Rate Risk We
      invest
      in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments
      in
      commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
      corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
      These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities .
      All of
      the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
      floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate
      risk.
      Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to
      a
      rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
      than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
      investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
      rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities
      that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because
      we classify our debt securities as “available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are
      recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold
      prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than
      temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
      a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed
      rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the
      yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values
      for
      these investments of approximately $3.0 million. Exchange
      Rate Risk We
      consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
      minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
      provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are
      not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United
      States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more
      expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,
      decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
      could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing
      business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with “  

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment
and Interest Rate Risk At
January 27, 2008 and January 28, 2007, we had $1.81 billion and $1.12 billion,
respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We
invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and
cash equivalents, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money
market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities
and the United States government and its agencies. As of January 27, 2008,
we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. These
investments are denominated in United States dollars. We
account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities . All of the cash equivalents and marketable
securities are treated as “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments
in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree
of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value
adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in
part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of
expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of
our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be
other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell
securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest
rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as
“available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to
changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or
unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These
securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of January
27, 2008, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate
financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield
curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these
investments of approximately $3.1 million. Recent U.S.
sub-prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors
of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. The
short-term funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth
quarter of calendar 2007, leading to liquidity disruption in the market. If the
global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be
impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which
could adversely impact our financial results. As of January 27, 2008, we did not
have any issuer concentration in excess of 10% of our investment portfolio.
However, our investments in the financial sector and government agencies
accounted for approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of our total investment
portfolio. If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline
by 2%-5%, it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments
by approximately $22-$54 million. Exchange
Rate Risk We
consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
minimal.  Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are
included in “Other income (expense), net” in our Consolidated Financial
Statements and to date have not been significant.  The aggregate
exchange loss included in determining net income was $1.7 million in fiscal year
2008 and $0.5 million in fiscal year 2007.  The impact of exchange
gain/loss was not material in fiscal year 2006.  Currently, sales and
arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in
United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate
fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to
other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively
impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United
States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers
raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the
future. We may
enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to
reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at January
27, 2008. 57

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
should be read in conjunction with “  

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK Investment
and Interest Rate Risk As of January
25, 2009 and January 27, 2008, we had $1.26 billion and $1.81 billion,
respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We
invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and
cash equivalents, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money
market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United
States government and its agencies. As of January 25, 2009, we did not have
any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. Our investments are
denominated in United States dollars. We account
for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities . All of the cash equivalents and marketable
securities are treated as “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments
in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree
of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value
adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in
part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of
expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of
our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be
other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell
securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest
rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as
“available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations due to changes in interest rates unless such
securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined
to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value
with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of
tax. As of January
25, 2009, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate
financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield
curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values
for these investments of approximately $4.4 million. The current
financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the
possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business
have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in
many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency
and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit
crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in
product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain
credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer, including channel
partner, insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions, which may
negatively impact our treasury operations. Other income and expense could also
vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the
sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges related to debt
securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash,
cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. The current volatility in
the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that
the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could
differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. For
instance, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $9.9
million during fiscal year 2009. These charges include $5.6 million related to
what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the
money market funds held by the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd., or
International Reserve Fund; $2.5 million related to a decline in the value of
publicly traded equity securities and $1.8 million related to debt securities
held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of
January 25, 2009.   Please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,

Fiscal year 2010 includes impact of charge for a tender offer to purchase an
aggregate of 28.5 million outstanding stock options for a total cash payment of
$78.1 million. As a result of the tender offer the Company incurred a charge of
$140.2 million, consisting of the remaining unamortized stock-based compensation
expenses associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the
offer, stock-based compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of
the fair value of the underlying options, plus associated payroll taxes and
professional fees. (C)  Fiscal
year 2010 includes an additional net warranty charge of $95.9 million against
cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return,
replacement and other costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set in
certain versions of our previous generation products used in notebook systems.
This charge included an additional accrual of $164.4 million for related
estimated costs, offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of $70.5 that
we recorded.  $68.6 million and $1.9 million of the reimbursement was
allocated to cost of revenue and legal expense, respectively. (D)
Fiscal year 2009 includes $196.0 million for a warranty charge against cost of
revenue arising from a weak die/packaging material set; a benefit of $8.0

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read
in conjunction with “  

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK Investment
and Interest Rate Risk As of January 31, 2010 and
January 25, 2009, we had $1.73 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively, in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities. We invest in a variety of
financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents,
asset-backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by
Government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money market funds and debt
securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government
and its agencies. As of January 31, 2010, we did not have any investments in
auction-rate preferred securities. Our investments are denominated in United
States dollars. All of the cash equivalents and
marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale.” Investments in both
fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of
interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely
impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may
produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these
factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to
changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded
debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer
losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in
securities market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any
debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or
losses are realized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations due to
changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or
unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These
securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of
stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of January 31, 2010, we
performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial
investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of
both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these
investments of approximately $8.3 million. The financial turmoil that
affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility
that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in
a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial
markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity
markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on
our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays;
inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance
purchases of our products and/or customer, including channel partner,
insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions, which may negatively impact
our treasury operations. Other income and expense could also vary materially
from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange
of financial instruments; impairment charges related to debt securities as well
as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash, cash equivalent and
marketable securities balances. Volatility in the financial markets and economic
uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on
our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values
currently assigned to them. As of January 31, 2010, our investments in
government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented
approximately 62% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector
accounted for approximately 22% of our total investment portfolio.  Of
the financial sector investments, over half are guaranteed by the U.S.
government.  Substantially all of our investments are with A/A2 or
better rated securities.  If the fair value of our investments in
these sectors was to decline by 2%-5%, fair market values for these investments
would decline by approximately $27-$67 million. Exchange
Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure
to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal.  Gains or losses
from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “Other income (expense),
net” in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been
significant.  The impact of foreign currency transaction loss included
in determining net income (loss) for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $0.9
million, $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively.  Currently,
sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and
payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange
rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative
to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could
negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of
the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our
suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the
future. We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are
designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at
January 31, 2010. 58

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk As of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011 , we had $3.13 billion and $2.49 billion , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. As of January 29, 2012 , we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. Our investments are denominated in United States dollars. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale.” Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of January 29, 2012 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately $13.7 million . The financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions, which may negatively impact our treasury operations. Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. As of January 29, 2012 , our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 51% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for approximately 24% of our total investment portfolio.  Of the financial sector investments, over half are guaranteed by the U.S. government.  Substantially all of our investments are with A/A2 or better rated securities.  If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2%-5%, the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately $43 - $107 million . Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal.  Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “Other income (expense), net” in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant.  The impact of foreign currency transaction gain (loss) included in determining net income (loss) for fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $1.6 million , $(2.4) million and $(0.9) million, respectively.  Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, 55 Table of Contents which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at January 29, 2012 .

As of January 29, 2017 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $33 million .

Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 28, 2018 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $14 million . In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes which had $15 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 28, 2018 . We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Convertible Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates.

Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 38.0 38.8 Gross profit 62.0 61.2 Operating expenses: Research and development 25.9 20.3 Sales, general and administrative 10.0 8.5 Total operating expenses 35.9 28.7 Income from operations 26.1 32.5 Interest income 1.6 1.2 Interest expense (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Other, net — 0.1 Total other income 1.1 0.8 Income before income tax expense 27.2 33.3 Income tax expense (benefit) 1.6 (2.1 ) Net income 25.6 % 35.3 % Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) GPU $ 9,465 $ 10,175 $ (710 ) (7 )% Tegra Processor 1,453 1,541 (88 ) (6 )% Total $ 10,918 $ 11,716 $ (798 ) (7 )% GPU Business. GPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , which reflects a decline in GPUs sold for gaming. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce 28 Table of Contents desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales. Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 . This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively . Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019 . Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019. Operating Expenses Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 2,829 $ 2,376 $ 453 19 % % of net revenue 25.9 % 20.3 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,093 991 102 10 % % of net revenue 10.0 % 8.5 % Total operating expenses $ 3,922 $ 3,367 $ 555 16 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. 29 Table of Contents Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income, Net Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178 million and $ 136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 26, 2020 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $1 million. In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of 35 Table of Contents revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million. Inventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within Quadro/Nvidia RTX. Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center compute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions. Operating Expenses Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 3,924 $ 2,829 $ 1,095 39 % % of net revenue 23.5 % 25.9 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,940 1,093 847 77 % % of net revenue 11.6 % 10.0 % Total operating expenses $ 5,864 $ 3,922 $ 1,942 50 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation. Other Income (Expense), Net Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 36 Table of Contents The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $8 million, respectively. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 35.1 37.7 Gross profit 64.9 62.3 Operating expenses: Research and development 19.6 23.5 Sales, general and administrative 8.0 11.6 Total operating expenses 27.6 35.1 Income from operations 37.3 27.2 Interest income 0.1 0.3 Interest expense (0.9) (1.1) Other, net 0.4 0.1 Other income (expense), net (0.4) (0.7) Income before income tax expense 36.9 26.5 Income tax expense 0.7 0.5 Net income 36.2 % 26.0 % 35 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Graphics $ 15,868 $ 9,834 $ 6,034 61 % Compute & Networking 11,046 6,841 4,205 61 % Total $ 26,914 $ 16,675 $ 10,239 61 % Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining. Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking. Inventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs. The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions. 36 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 5,268 $ 3,924 $ 1,344 34 % % of net revenue 19.6 % 23.5 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 2,166 1,940 226 12 % % of net revenue 8.0 % 11.6 % Total operating expenses $ 7,434 $ 5,864 $ 1,570 27 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles. Other Income (Expense), Net Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense was $236 million and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021. Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,   

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively. At January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 43.1 35.1 Gross profit 56.9 64.9 Operating expenses Research and development 27.2 19.6 Sales, general and administrative 9.1 8.0 Acquisition termination cost 5.0 — Total operating expenses 41.3 27.6 Income from operations 15.6 37.3 Interest income 1.0 0.1 Interest expense (1.0) (0.9) Other, net (0.1) 0.4 Other income (expense), net (0.1) (0.4) Income before income tax 15.5 36.9 Income tax expense (benefit) (0.7) 0.7 Net income 16.2 % 36.2 % 41 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute & Networking $ 15,068 $ 11,046 $ 4,022 36 % Graphics 11,906 15,868 (3,962) (25) % Total $ 26,974 $ 26,914 $ 60 — % Compute & Networking - The year-on-year increase was led by growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects purchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud service offerings and our research and development activities. The increase was also related to the growth in Automotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023 compared to $550 million in fiscal year 2022. Graphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan related to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations. Gross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $2.17 billion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections. Inventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions. Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory and related provisions and lower margins of GeForce GPUs. 42 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 7,339 $ 5,268 $ 2,071 39 % % of revenue 27.2 % 19.6 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 2,440 2,166 274 13 % % of revenue 9.1 % 8.0 % Acquisition termination cost 1,353 — 1,353 100 % % of revenue 5.0 % — % Total operating expenses $ 11,132 $ 7,434 $ 3,698 50 % % of revenue 41.3 % 27.6 % The increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation, employee growth, engineering development costs, and data center infrastructure. The increase in sales, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation and employee growth. We recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Interest income $ 267 $ 29 $ 238 821 % Interest expense (262) (236) (26) 11 % Other, net (48) 107 (155) (145) % Other income (expense), net $ (43) $ (100) $ 57 (57) % Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher yields earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion debt offering issued in June 2021. Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in other, net, compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses from publicly traded equity investments and changes in value from our non-affiliated private investments.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $17 million. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and
reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. We are
one of the world’s largest “fabless” semiconductor companies, supplying graphics and media communications processors and related software that are integral to personal computers, professional workstations and digital entertainment
platforms. We provide an architecturally compatible “top-to-bottom” family of award-winning graphics processing units, or GPUs, which set the standard for performance, quality, compatibility and features for a broad range personal
computing platforms. Our graphics and communications processors are used for a wide variety of applications, including games, digital content creation, personal digital image editing, business productivity and product and industrial design. Our
mission is to be the most important visual computing company in the world. Recent Developments Microsoft Pricing Settlement We were engaged with Microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the Xbox chipset. These discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on April 23, 2002 Microsoft submitted the
matter to binding arbitration. On February 6, 2003, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced that the companies had settled all issues related to pricing of the Microsoft Xbox GPU and MCP chipset and have ended the arbitration between them. In addition to
resolving this pricing dispute, we have agreed to collaborate with Microsoft on future cost reductions for the Xbox. As a result of the settlement, we recognized $40.4 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2003. Strategic Alliance with IBM On March 26, 2003, we announced that we have formed a
multi-year strategic alliance under which IBM will manufacture our next-generation GeForce GPUs. As part of the agreement, we will gain access to IBM’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies, including power-efficient copper
wiring, and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm (nanometer; a billionth of a meter) in the next several years, giving us valuable tools to advance our GPUs. IBM plans to begin manufacturing the next-generation GeForce graphics processor this
summer at IBM’s plant in East Fishkill, New York. Beyond the chip manufacturing technology, IBM also offers an automated management system that not only controls production on the factory floor, but provides a connection for customer and supplier systems and processes, allowing
closer integration across the supply chain. IBM’s automated management system provides us with opportunities ranging from improved operation to greater efficiency and competitive advantage, while using e-business techniques to adapt to
real-time, on-demand influences from the marketplace. Securities & Exchange Commission In April 2003, subsequent to receiving a Wells notice indicating the SEC staff intended to recommend to the SEC that an enforcement action be initiated, we reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff that would resolve the
SEC’s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement. The agreement is subject to final approval of the SEC. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, NVIDIA, without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing, would agree to
an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations 13 Table of Contents of certain non-fraud financial reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. We would not be
required to pay any fines or penalties. The documentation of the agreement and the SEC’s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete. Further, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the SEC. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to customer programs, revenue recognition, sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit
committee of our board of directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this MD&A. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is
fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the
product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of
revenue at the time the incentive is offered. We also record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on historical return rates. For all sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as
evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is
reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and for
estimated losses resulting from the financial inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general
estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. As of January 26, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts
was $4.2 million and our gross trade receivable balance was $175.1 million. Of the $175.1 million, $42.4 million was covered by credit insurance and $4.2 million was covered by letters of credit. As a percentage of our gross trade receivables,
our allowance for 14 Table of Contents doubtful accounts has ranged between 1% and 2%. As of January 26, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 2% of our gross trade
receivables. If our allowance for doubtful accounts would have been recorded at 1% or 3% of gross trade receivables then our balance at January 26, 2003 would have been approximately $1.8 million or $5.3 million, respectively, rather than the
actual balance of $4.2 million. Inventories We write down our inventory for estimated
lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are
less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are
sold. No significant sales of such products have occurred to date. Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“SFAS 109”) establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with
SFAS 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax
liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available
evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. For the fiscal year ended January 26, 2003, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $54.4 million that we believe will be recovered. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover any or part of the deferred tax asset of
$54.4 million, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable. As of January 26, 2003, we recorded a valuation allowance of $106.7. The valuation allowance is attributable to certain net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, when realized, will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders’
equity. Restatement On April 29, 2002, the Company announced that it would be
restating its previously reported results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 and for fiscal years 2001 and 2000. This restatement was the result of an extensive review directed by the Company’s independent Audit Committee, with
assistance from the law firm of Cooley Godward LLP and forensic accountants from KPMG LLP. The Company’s Audit Committee initiated its review at the request of, and in full cooperation with, the staff of the Securities & Exchange Commission
(SEC). The Company’s Audit Committee and its team conducted a thorough review of the Company’s records with respect to all issues raised by the SEC staff for the periods mentioned. The Company’s Audit Committee worked in close
cooperation with the SEC to provide it with extensive information and conclusions of the review. As discussed in the Form 8-K filed by NVIDIA on May 1, 2002, the adjustments that were reflected in our restated financial statements fell generally into four categories: • The first category involved mistakes that were found as a result of the internal review process undertaken by our Audit Committee. An example of this first category
is the accidental double-booking of an expense. • The second category involved adjustments relating to estimates made in connection with accruals, in which we concluded that there was not sufficient current evidence
to support an estimate. 15 Table of Contents • The third area related to past accounting judgments that, upon review, we concluded were incorrect, but we did not reach a conclusion whether they were made in good
faith or bad faith. • The fourth category related to waived audit adjustments for prior periods, which were items previously identified as part of the normal quarterly review and annual
audit process, but for which we had concluded we were not required to make adjusting entries in order to prepare our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles. For additional information on the restatement, refer to Note
13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results
of Operations The following table sets
forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 26, 2003 January 27, 2002 January 28, 2001 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 69.5 62.1 62.9 Cost of revenue related to stock option exchange 0.3 — — Gross profit 30.2 37.9 37.1 Operating expenses: Research and development 11.8 11.3 11.7 Sales, general and administrative 7.9 7.2 8.0 Stock option exchange 2.9 — — Amortization of goodwill 0.0 0.7 — Acquisition related charges 0.0 0.7 — Discontinued use of property 0.0 0.3 — Total operating expenses 22.6 20.2 19.7 Operating income 7.6 17.7 17.4 Interest and other income, net 0.3 0.8 2.3 Income before income tax expense 7.9 18.5 19.7 Income tax expense 3.1 5.5 6.3 Net income 4.8 % 13.0 % 13.4 % Fiscal Years Ended January 26, 2003, January 27, 2002, and January 28, 2001 Revenue Revenue was $1.91 billion in fiscal 2003, $1.37 billion in fiscal 2002, and $735.3 million in fiscal 2001, which represented an increase
of 39% from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and 86% from fiscal 2001 to 2002. The growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by significant shipments of Xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our
products in the workstation, mobile and platform processor product lines. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and North America accounted for 68% and 82% of total revenue for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual
countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers located in the United States. The decrease
in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States is primarily attributable to increased sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the Microsoft Xbox product billed to Microsoft in the United
States. 16 Table of Contents Although we
achieved substantial growth in revenue from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and fiscal 2001 to 2002, we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the
lives of the products. The declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists
primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors (including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such purchases), final test yield
fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margins were 30%, 38% and 37% in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to the shift in mix of business and an inventory write-down. During fiscal 2003, sales of Xbox processors, which generally have
lower margins than our other products, comprised 23% of our overall revenue as compared to 9% in fiscal 2002. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our relationship with Microsoft. In addition,
during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we wrote down inventory of approximately $21 million related to certain Xbox processors and nForce chipsets. Gross margin increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increase in unit shipments and the
favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin Xbox graphics and media communication processors. In the future, we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional
write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins. Although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit during fiscal 2003 from the same period a year ago, we
do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. Operating Expenses Research and Development .    Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and
development expenses increased by $70.1 million, or 45%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $32.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $22.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees
and depreciation charges, a $4.5 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.5 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of
occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year. Research and development expenses increased by $68.7 million, or 80%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $31.9 million increase related to additional
personnel, including certain employees hired from 3dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below, a $14.3 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation
charges, a $11.7 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other expenses during the
year. We anticipate that we will continue to
devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and
development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues. Sales, General and
Administrative .    Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting
expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $52.5 million, or 53%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $16.4 million increase related to additional personnel and 17 Table of Contents commissions, a $16.6 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings, a $9.0 million increase in
equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems, a $7.9 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $2.6 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our
headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2
million, or 69%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $21.5 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $6.2 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $12.5 million increase in facilities costs
due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities, an American Red Cross donation associated with the events of September 11, 2001, and travel and entertainment
expenses. We expect sales, general and
administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations, expand our sales and protect our business interests. Stock Option Exchange On September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer (the “Offer”) to our employees to exchange outstanding
stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share (“Eligible Options”). Stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer,
representing approximately 39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date. Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24,
2002 were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical, maternity, worker’s compensation, military or other statutorily protected leave of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in the
Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board of
Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. Eligible employees who participated in the Offer received, in exchange for the cancellation of Eligible Options, a fixed amount of consideration, represented by fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock and applicable withholding
taxes, equal to the number of shares underlying such Eligible Options, multiplied by $3.20, less the amount of applicable tax withholdings, divided by $10.46, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on October
24, 2002. We concluded that the consideration paid for the Eligible Options represented “substantial consideration” as required by Issue 39(f) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 “Issues Relating to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB
Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44,” as the $3.20 per Eligible Option was at least the fair value for each Eligible Option, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the fair value of the Eligible
Options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we used the following assumptions: (i) the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options, which was approximately 7.8 years; (ii) a volatility of 50.0% during the
expected life; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 3.71%; and (iv) no dividends. The amount of $3.20 per Eligible Option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period. Variable accounting is not required under Issue 39(a) of EITF
Issue No. 00-23 for Eligible Options subject to the Offer that were not surrendered for cancellation, because: (i) the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non-forfeitable; and (ii)
the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the Offer was based on the number of surrendered Eligible Options multiplied by $3.20, divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange. We further concluded that the
“look back” and “look forward” provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44, paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation. Based on the terms of the Offer, variable accounting is not required for any of
our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the Offer. We do not intend to grant stock options to any participants in the Offer for at least six months following October 24, 2002. If any stock options are granted to 18 Table of Contents participants in the Offer within the six months following October 24, 2002, those stock options will receive variable accounting. On October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and
we were obligated to exchange approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61,832,000, consisting of $39,906,000 in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21,926,000 in
employer and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the closing price of
our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share. The shares of our common stock issued in exchange for Eligible Options were fully vested. However, a portion of the shares equal to 25% of the total consideration, based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer
termination date, have a six month holding period, and a portion of the shares equal to 25% of such total consideration have a one year holding period. Withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50% of the total
consideration, and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction. Amortization of Goodwill During fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The initial allocation of the purchase price included $57.4 million of goodwill, plus
approximately $3.0 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place, which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , we no longer amortize goodwill
as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. We have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We have completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and concluded that there was no
impairment. Acquisition Related Charges Acquisition related charges are
attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002. These charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former 3dfx employees. Discontinued Use of Property Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa Clara, California.
Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs related to the
preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net decreased to $6.6 million in fiscal 2003 from $11.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $16.7 million in fiscal
2001. Interest income, which primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased $4.5 million from fiscal 2002 to 2003 due to the decline in market interest rates. Interest income increased $6.4
million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to higher average cash balances as a result of a $200.0 million advance received from Microsoft in connection with our agreement with Microsoft and the receipt of $387.5 million from our 4¾%
convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings, which both closed in October 2000. Interest expense, which primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt was flat from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Interest expense
increased in fiscal 2002 19 Table of Contents compared to fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated notes in October 2000. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $59.8 million, $75.8
million and $46.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were 39.7% in fiscal 2003, 30.0% in fiscal 2002 and 32.0% in fiscal 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to
fiscal 2003 was primarily due to not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be
available. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 26, 2003, we had $1.03 billion in cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $237.0 million from the end of fiscal 2002. In August 2001, we began to invest in marketable securities. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several
financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities generated cash of $265.0 million, $160.8 million and $267.9 million during fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the decrease in inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets offset
by the decrease in accounts payable. Cash used
in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities, the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities. Net
cash used in investing activities was $277.3 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to $217.3 million of net purchases of marketable securities. We incurred $63.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 primarily attributable to our new
headquarters facility, as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development. We expect to spend approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2004, primarily for
software licenses, emulation equipment, computer and engineering workstations and future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or
assets. Financing activities provided cash of
$26.3 million during fiscal 2003 compared to $99.1 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was due to a decrease in employee stock option exercises. Common Stock and Convertible Subordinated Debenture
Offering In October 2000, we sold 2,800,000
shares of our common stock and $300.0 million of convertible subordinated debentures due October 15, 2007 in a public offering. Proceeds from the offering were approximately $387.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and
offering expenses. Issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debentures. Interest on the convertible subordinated debentures accrues at the rate of 4 ¾% per
annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2001. The convertible subordinated debentures are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The debentures are convertible at the
option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $46.36 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 20 Table of Contents 3dfx Asset
Purchase On April 18, 2001, we completed
the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a
Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provides, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx certifies to our satisfaction all its debts and other liabilities have been provided for, then we
are obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx cannot make such a certification, but instead certifies to our satisfaction that its debts and liabilities can be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx can elect
to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx cannot certify that all
of its debts and liabilities have been provided for, or can be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we are not obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. On October 15, 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. We believe that the bankruptcy filing by 3dfx will allow a determination of the full number and scope of 3dfx’s debts and liabilities. NVIDIA may be obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to pay 3dfx the contingent
consideration following this determination, subject to offsets for NVIDIA’s claims against 3dfx arising from the Asset Purchase Agreement. On March 12, 2003, we were served with a complaint by the Trustee for 3dfx seeking, among other things,
additional payment for the purchased assets and the assumption by us of 3dfx’s liabilities. In addition, Carlyle Fortran Trust and CarrAmerica, former landlords of 3dfx, have filed suits against us seeking payment of the rents due by
3dfx. Contractual Cash Obligations The following summarizes our contractual
cash obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of January 26, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Convertible subordinated notes $ 300,000 — — $ 300,000 — Interest on convertible subordinated notes(1) $ 67,687 $ 14,250 $ 28,500 $ 24,937 — Capital lease obligations $ 11,316 $ 6,260 $ 5,056 — — Operating leases $ 219,096 $ 22,995 $ 46,180 $ 47,201 $ 102,720 Purchase obligations(2) $ 210,270 $ 210,270 — — — Royalty and license commitments $ 2,612 $ 1,871 $ 741 — — Other $ 520 — $ 520 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 811,501 $ 255,646 $ 80,997 $ 372,138 $ 102,720 (1) Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾%. The amount of interest obligation assumes that the notes are held until
maturity and not redeemed or converted into shares of common stock at an earlier date. The convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time
prior to the close of business on the maturity date. As such, actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower. (2) Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments as of January 26, 2003. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated
cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame.
Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, 21 Table of Contents which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek
additional borrowings or capital include: • decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; • inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products; • competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and • new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see “Business Risks—Our operating results are unpredictable and may
fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.” Other Information Consistent with Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by Section 202 of the Public Company Accounting Reform
and Investor Protection Act of 2002, NVIDIA is responsible for disclosing the nature of the non-audit services approved by our Audit Committee during a quarter to be performed by KPMG LLP, our independent auditor. Non-audit services are services
other than those provided by KPMG LLP in connection with an audit or a review of NVIDIA’s financial statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, our Audit Committee did approve new and recurring engagements performed by KPMG LLP
for the following non-audit services (1) income tax, transactional tax and payroll tax return preparation, (2) general tax consultation and advice, (3) international statutory audits, and (4) consultation regarding accounting standards and issues. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set
forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading “New Accounting Pronouncements,” which information is hereby incorporated by reference.   

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the U.S. Government and its
agencies. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (“SFAS No. 115”), Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . All of the cash
equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may
have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of
expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because our debt securities are classified as
“available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included
in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of January 26, 2003, a sensitivity analysis was performed on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. Parallel shifts in the yield curve of
both +/-50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $3.5 million. Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾% and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations. 22 Table of Contents Exchange Rate Risk We consider our exposure to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in
any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. Business Risks In addition to the risks discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” our business is subject to the risks set forth below. Risks Related to Our Operations Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline. Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to
predict, and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating
results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected
by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations. Factors that have affected our results of operations in the past, and could affect our results of operations in the future, include the following: • demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; • the successful development and volume production of next-generation products; • new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors; • our ability to introduce new products in accordance with OEM design requirements and design cycles; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products; • fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields; • declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the U.S. and international economies; • competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders; • the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship; • seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market; • substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism or other cause; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory devices; • our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products; • legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits; • bad debt write-offs; 23 Table of Contents • costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products; • unexpected inventory write-downs; and • introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent
us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed, and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. Therefore, we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Most of our operating expenses are
relatively fixed in the short term, and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall. Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than
long-term agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm
our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build memory and component
inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major OEMs. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write-downs if growth slows or if
we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. We may be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. If new competitors, technological
advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts, our business could suffer. Accordingly, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year. We need to develop new products and to
manage product transitions in order to succeed. Our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for the 3D graphics market. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system
configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics
in order to be included in new system configurations. This requires that we do the following: • anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand; • incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of PC OEMs, CEMs and add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers; • price our products competitively; and • introduce the products to the market within the limited window for PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for
research and development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following: • proper new product definition; • timely completion and introduction of new product designs; 24 Table of Contents • the ability of IBM, TSMC and any additional third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner; • the quality of any new products; • differentiation of new products from those of our competitors; • market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products; and • availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products. Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products
and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by PC OEMs, add-in board
and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of 3D graphics. In addition, we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the PC OEMs’ design cycles and market demand. We
have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3D graphics products would harm our business. In particular, we experienced delays
in the introduction of graphics processors using our next generation technology during the second half of fiscal 2003 and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products
could materially harm our business. Our
failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business. As our 3D graphics processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short
and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our 3D graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we will need to
introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins. In order for our 3D graphics processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers must select our 3D graphics processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and
bring to market in a timely fashion new products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will
be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products
and that there will be delays in the development, introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of
new products we developed. In addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could
result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our 3D graphics products non-competitive or obsolete or result in
our holding excess inventory, any of which would harm our business. We could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects. Products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to
existing products are released. We have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future. Errors in
new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. Our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and
distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. 25 Table of Contents If these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers
for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products would reduce our
gross margins. Semiconductor
manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures,
yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be
identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer. The risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our manufacturers, increasing the
effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an
increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships, as well as revenue and gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or
maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing
defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, our business could suffer. Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete
effectively. Our strategy is to utilize
the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid
change and require significant expenditures for research and development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We currently use 0.15-micron
process technology for the GeForce4, Quadro4, GeForce3, Quadro DCC, Xbox and nForce families of graphics processors, and we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position.
In November 2002, we introduced our newest flagship GPU, the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra, which is our first GPU to be manufactured in 0.13-micron process technology. Other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new
manufacturing processes and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. We have experienced and may continue to experience similar difficulties and the corresponding negative effects.
Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. We may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis. We may be unable to manage our growth and,
as a result, may be unable to successfully implement our strategy. Our rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. As of January 26, 2003, we had 1,513 employees as
compared to 1,123 employees as of January 27, 2002. We expect that the number of our employees will increase over the next 12 months. Our future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational,
financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis, as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls. Further, we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties. Our
systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy. 26 Table of Contents We are
dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. None of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement, and so our
relationships with these officers and employees are at will. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, technical personnel or other key
employees, particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure
to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business. Our reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly, testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated
with conducting business outside of the United States, including the following: • unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; • delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; • longer payment cycles; • imposition of additional taxes and penalties; • the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and • other factors beyond our control, including terrorism and war, which may delay the shipment of our products. We also are subject to general political risks in connection
with our international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property
rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and to date we
have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. Hostilities involving the United States and/or terrorist attacks could harm our business. The financial, political, economic and
other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the  United States have led to a weakening of the global economy. Recent economic data, such as the United States unemployment rate and consumer confidence measures, appear to indicate
that international hostilities involving the United States has further weakened the global economy. The reduction in business and investor confidence is also reflected in the weakening equity markets. Subsequent terrorist acts and/or the threat of
future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the United States or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In
addition, any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers, distributors and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure in operation or future enhancement
or implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could harm our operations. During fiscal 2003, we initiated an examination of SAP A.G., our current enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to enhance our information systems in business, finance, operations and service.
During fiscal 2003, we implemented certain additional functionalities based upon the results of the ERP examination and we expect 27 Table of Contents to implement additional functionalities in fiscal 2004. If we are not able to implement additional functionalities to our current ERP system
or there are delays or downtime as a result of the implementation, the efficiency of our business applications and business operations could be harmed. We are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems to conduct our
business. System failure or malfunctioning may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process transactions. Our results of operations and financial position could be harmed if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to system
operations or future implementations. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: • the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval; • the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; • a classified board of directors; and • advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics
chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. In the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability
to grow our business and sell our products. In the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products, services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels. For any
previous or future acquisition or investment, the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and, ultimately, could impair our ability to sell our products: • difficulty in combining the technology, operations or workforce of the acquired business; • disruption of our ongoing businesses; • difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction; • difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and • possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel. In addition, the consideration for
any future acquisition could be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock. If the consideration is paid with our common stock, existing stockholders would be further diluted. Risks Related to Our Partners We are dependent on a small number of customers and we
are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. We primarily sell our products to add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs, which incorporate graphics products in the 28 Table of Contents boards they sell to PC OEMs and system builders. Sales to add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs are primarily dependent on
achieving design wins with leading PC OEMs. The number of add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and leading PC OEMs is limited. We expect that a small number of  add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs directly, and a
small number of PC OEMs indirectly, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our business could be harmed by the loss of business from PC OEMs or add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and CEMs. In addition, revenue from add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and PC OEMs that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or may
not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. Our business may be harmed by instability in Asia due to the concentration of customers who are located or have substantial operations in Asia, including Taiwan. The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan have in the past
experienced strained relations. A worsening of these relationships or the development of hostilities between the two could result in disruptions in Taiwan and possibly other areas of Asia, which could harm our business. In addition, if relations
between the U.S. and The People’s Republic of China become strained, our business could be harmed. While we believe political instability in Asia has not harmed our business, because of our reliance on companies with operations in Asia,
continued economic and political instability in Asia might harm it. Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income, which could harm our business. Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our
customers’ businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an
amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure, excluding the amounts covered by credit insurance. If the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain credit insurance in the future. We may have
to record additional reserves or write-offs in the future, which could harm our business. We rely on third-party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products. In the design and development of new products and product
enhancements, we rely on third-party software development tools. While we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have
experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to
meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from 3D graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the software development tools we use become unavailable or
fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that the Xbox program will achieve long term commercial success. There can be no assurance that the Xbox program will achieve long term commercial success, given the high level of competition in the game
console product line. During fiscal 2003, sales of Xbox processors comprised 23% of our overall revenue. If the Xbox program is not successful, our business may be harmed. We depend on foreign foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third
parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our business. We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products
require wafers manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We primarily utilize TSMC to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent 29 Table of Contents subcontractors to perform assembly, testing and packaging. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing
capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-term
manufacturing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and TSMC has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC fabricates wafers for other companies, including certain of our
competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several
quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product. We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC and any other manufacturers used by us to
ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of TSMC. Although our products are designed using TSMC’s process design rules, TSMC may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable yields
or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and/or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, TSMC may not continue to devote resources to the production of our products, or to advance the process design technologies on which the
manufacturing of our products are based. Any difficulties like these would harm our business. Because of our reliance on TSMC, our business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan,
or if relations between the U.S. and The People’s Republic of China are strained due to foreign relations events. Furthermore, any substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, either as a result of a natural disaster, political
unrest, economic instability, acts of terrorism or war, equipment failure or other cause, could harm our business. There can be no assurance that IBM will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and
deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis. On March 26, 2003, we announced that we have formed a multi-year strategic alliance under which IBM will manufacture our next-generation
GeForce GPUs. As part of the agreement, we will gain access to IBM’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies, including power-efficient copper wiring, and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm (nanometer; a billionth of a
meter) in the next several years, giving us valuable tools to advance our GPUs. IBM plans to begin manufacturing the next-generation GeForce graphics processor this summer at IBM’s plant in East Fishkill, New York. During the development of our relationship with IBM, our
manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of IBM. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result
in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit. We also face the risk of product recalls or
product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, our business could suffer. We are dependent on third parties for
assembly, testing and packaging of our products. Our graphics processors are assembled and tested by Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., Amkor Technology, ChipPAC Incorporated and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering. We do not have  long-term agreements with any of
these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality. Any product shortages or quality
assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business. Due to the amount of time 30 Table of Contents typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are
required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components. Any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Competition The 3D graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete. The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs in which we
compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of
product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards and
motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3D graphics processors, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by
our products. We may be unable to compete successfully in the emerging PC graphics market. Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include the following: • suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Intel, Silicon Integrated
Systems, ATI Technologies Inc. and VIA Technologies, Inc.; • suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally developed graphics chips, such as  ATI Technologies Inc., Creative Technology and Matrox
Electronics Systems Ltd.; • suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies Inc., Trident
Microsystems, Inc. and the joint venture of a division of SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3 Incorporated) and VIA Technologies, Inc.; and • companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including 3Dlabs (a Creative
Technology company) and ATI Technologies Inc. If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor market, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately
predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. We may not successfully compete with Intel in the integrated chipset product line. It is projected by analysts that integrated chipsets are likely to become a majority share of the PC graphics market. We
have recently introduced and begun shipment of the nForce2 platform processor, our second generation integrated 3D graphics chipset. The nForce platform processor is initially designed to support microprocessors produced by AMD. Intel is the
dominant supplier of integrated 3D graphics chipsets. Intel has significantly greater resources than we do, and the nForce platform processor, or other 3D graphics products that we may introduce, may not compete effectively against Intel’s
current chipset products or its future products, either in terms of price or performance. In addition, due to the widespread industry acceptance of Intel’s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture, including its accelerated graphics port architecture, or AGP, Intel
exercises significant influence over the PC industry and over companies developing products for such architecture. Any significant modifications by Intel to the AGP, the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects of the PC
microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our technology, which would harm our business. 31 Table of Contents In addition, any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm our business. In addition to its influence over the PC architecture, Intel
has asserted intellectual property rights in various PC architecture interfaces. For example, as a result of patents held by Intel, it has asserted that companies wishing to develop a chipset compatible with the Pentium 4 microprocessor or similar
microprocessors obtain a license from Intel. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity
to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. In September 2001 Intel filed a patent infringement suit against VIA Technologies, Inc. with respect to a
VIA Technologies, Inc. chipset for the Pentium 4. We do not have a license from Intel for such a chipset. We expect Intel to continue to do the following: • invest heavily in research and development and continue development of integrated 3D graphics products; • maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of PC microprocessors; • use its intellectual property position with respect to the PC microprocessor and architecture to defend its position in 3D graphics, including the filing of patent
infringement suits against competitors; • follow business practices in its PC business, which strongly encourage use of Intel integrated chipsets; • increasingly dominate the PC platform; and • promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to engender brand loyalty among PC users. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would
harm our business. Our future success
will depend in large part on achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the 3D graphics processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs and add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, generally based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must
have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. The
process of being qualified for inclusion in a PC OEM’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature, which also could harm our business. Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our
ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including
Intel and Microsoft. This would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant
period of time, our ability to achieve design wins could suffer. Risks Related to Financial and Market Conditions We are dependent on the PC market and the slowdown in its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. During fiscal 2003, we derived most of our revenue from the
sale of products for use in the desktop PC market, from professional workstations to low-cost PCs. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop PC market in the next several years.
The PC market is 32 Table of Contents characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and significant price
competition. These factors result in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, will reduce demand for
our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast
product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed. The slowing of both the domestic and international
economy has led to a reduction in the demand for PCs and to a reduction in inventory purchases by PC manufacturers, which adversely impacted our revenue during fiscal 2003. Any continued reduction in the demand for PCs generally, or for a particular
product that incorporates our 3D graphic processors, could harm our business. The acceptance of next generation products in business PC 3D graphics may not continue to develop. Our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3D graphics for business PC applications. The
market for performance 3D graphics on business PCs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future development of, and substantial end-user and OEM demand for, 3D graphics functionality. As a result, the market for business PC 3D
graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support our business. The development of the market for performance 3D graphics in business PCs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a large
number of business PC software applications that support or take advantage of performance 3D graphics capabilities. Currently, there are only a limited number of software applications like this, most of which are games, and a broader base of
software applications may not develop in the near term or at all. Consequently, a broad market for full function performance 3D graphics on business PCs may not develop. Our business prospects will suffer if the market for business PC 3D graphics
fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected. Our 3D graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the PC market. Our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our 3D graphics processors for high performance 3D graphics in PC
applications. The market for 3D graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic
random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have achieved broad market
acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition. Since the PC market is our core business, our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future 3D graphics processors do not
continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the PC market. If we are unable to complete the timely development of products, or if we were unable to successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the
PC market, our business would be harmed. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business. The semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the following factors: • rapid technological change; • cyclical market patterns; • significant average selling price erosion; • fluctuating inventory levels; • alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints; and • variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. 33 Table of Contents In addition,
the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times, characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in results of
operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions. Our stock price may continue to experience significant short-term fluctuations. The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of our common stock
may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are  non-company specific, such as the decline in the U.S. economy, acts of terror against the U.S., war or due to a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to
quarter variations in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price
of a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing company. Since February 2002, multiple securities class action lawsuits and several derivative suits have been filed against us. We expect that this
litigation, whether or not resolved favorably, may result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our revenues and earnings. Any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject
us to significant liabilities. See “Legal Proceedings” and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of this litigation. We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates. For additional information regarding
risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see  

 Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation and Government Action Our industry is characterized by
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has
resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. The 3D graphics market in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive
intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number
of issued hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in our product lines intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase. If infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the
claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights. However, licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could
cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products, which could reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for
infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products. Litigation against us or our customers concerning
infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We are currently subject to claims of patent infringement, and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other
parties in the future. We do not believe that current actions will have a material impact on our business or financial condition. However, these claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial
damages. 34 Table of Contents Our
ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing
arrangements to protect our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties.
The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to
effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These
licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross-licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. Future actions by the SEC or other governmental or
regulatory agencies and resolution of related litigation arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters could harm our business. The staff of the Enforcement Division of the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) informed
us in January 2002 that it had concerns relating to certain accounting matters and that the SEC along with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California had authorized investigations into such matters. In accordance with
the suggestion and advice of the SEC staff, we launched a review of these matters. On April 29, 2002, we announced that the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors had, with assistance from the law firm of Cooley Godward LLP and forensic auditors
from the accounting firm of KPMG LLP, concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate our financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002. The Audit Committee has worked and continues to
work in cooperation with the SEC. After receiving a Wells notice indicating the SEC staff intended to recommend to the SEC that an enforcement action be initiated, we reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff in April 2003 that would
resolve the SEC’s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement. The agreement is subject to final approval of the SEC. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, NVIDIA, without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing,
would agree to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain non-fraud financial reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. We would not be required to pay
any fines or penalties. The documentation of the agreement and the SEC’s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete. Further, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the SEC. Notwithstanding
the above, actions by the SEC or other governmental or regulatory agencies with respect to us or our personnel arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters may take significant time, may be expensive and may divert
management’s attention from other business concerns and harm our business.  

  ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by this item is set forth in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report.
